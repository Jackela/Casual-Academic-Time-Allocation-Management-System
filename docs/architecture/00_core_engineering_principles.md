## Architectural Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Ubiquitous Language**: All code, documentation, and communication must use domain terminology consistently
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear separation between business domains with explicit interfaces
- **Aggregate Roots**: Business logic encapsulation with proper transaction boundaries
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects for domain concepts without identity

### Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules must not depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has exactly one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities open for extension, closed for modification

### Microservices Patterns (Where Applicable)
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for external clients
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for external dependencies
- **Event Sourcing**: Capture state changes as events

---

## Code Quality Standards

### SOLID Principles (Mandatory)
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: One class, one purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Extend behavior without modifying existing code
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Many specific interfaces over one general
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Clean Code Requirements
- **Meaningful Names**: Self-documenting variable, function, and class names
- **Small Functions**: Functions should do one thing and do it well (max 20 lines)
- **No Magic Numbers**: All numeric literals must be named constants
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error handling, no silent failures
- **Consistent Formatting**: Automated formatting enforced via CI/CD

### Code Review Standards
- **No Code Without Review**: All changes require peer review
- **Automated Checks**: Linting, testing, and security scans must pass
- **Performance Review**: All changes assessed for performance impact
- **Security Review**: Security implications evaluated for every change

---

## Design Patterns & Practices

### Required Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation encapsulation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Algorithm families interchangeable
- **Observer Pattern**: Loose coupling for notifications
- **Command Pattern**: Request encapsulation for undo/logging

### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)
- **God Objects**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Singleton Abuse**: Overuse of global state
- **Magic Strings**: Hard-coded string literals
- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicated code blocks
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Favor object composition over class inheritance
- Use interfaces to define contracts
- Implement mixins/traits for shared behavior
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies (max 3 levels)

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid Implementation
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated, deterministic
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical user journeys only

### Test Quality Standards
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure
- **Test Independence**: Tests must not depend on each other
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Clear, specific test outcomes
- **Test Data Management**: Isolated test data per test
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies, test real logic

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum 80% Code Coverage**: Enforced via CI/CD
- **100% Critical Path Coverage**: All business logic paths
- **Mutation Testing**: Quality of tests, not just coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical endpoints

---

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify every request
- **JWT Best Practices**: Short-lived tokens, proper validation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for admin access

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Data Sanitization**: Input validation and output encoding
- **PII Handling**: Minimal collection, secure storage, timely deletion

### Security Testing
- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular testing against common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Security Code Review**: Security-focused peer review

---

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
- **API Endpoints**: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for complex queries
- **Page Load Times**: < 2 seconds first contentful paint
- **Background Jobs**: Appropriate timeout handling

### Scalability Principles
- **Stateless Design**: No session state in application servers
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for multiple instances
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching implementation
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and indexing

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Logging Standards**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Metrics Collection**: Business and technical metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow visibility
- **Alerting Strategy**: Proactive issue detection

---

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Code should explain itself
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Architecture Documentation**: C4 model diagrams
- **Decision Records**: ADRs for significant architectural decisions

### Process Documentation
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures documented
- **Incident Response**: Clear escalation procedures
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions

---

## AI Agent Behavior

### Code Generation Standards
- **Follow All Principles**: AI-generated code must adhere to this constitution
- **Security First**: Never generate insecure code patterns
- **Test Coverage**: Generate tests alongside implementation
- **Documentation**: Include appropriate documentation

### Review Requirements
- **Human Review**: All AI-generated code requires human review
- **Principle Compliance**: Verify adherence to engineering principles
- **Security Validation**: Security review for AI-generated code
- **Performance Assessment**: Performance impact evaluation

---

## Enforcement & Compliance

### Automated Enforcement
- **CI/CD Gates**: Automated checks prevent non-compliant code
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality tools enforce standards
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Performance Testing**: Automated performance regression detection

### Manual Review Process
- **Architecture Review Board**: Major changes require architectural review
- **Security Review**: Security team review for sensitive changes
- **Performance Review**: Performance impact assessment required
- **Documentation Review**: Documentation completeness verification

### Violation Handling
- **Immediate Fix**: Critical violations must be fixed immediately
- **Technical Debt**: Non-critical violations tracked as technical debt
- **Process Improvement**: Root cause analysis for systemic issues
- **Training**: Additional training for repeated violations
