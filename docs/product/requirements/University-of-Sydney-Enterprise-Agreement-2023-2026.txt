The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act 2022 (Amending Act) made a number
of changes to enterprise agreement approval processes in Part 2-4 of the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act), that
commenced operation on 6 June 2023. Under transitional arrangements, amendments made by Part 14 of
Schedule 1 to the Amending Act in relation to genuine agreement requirements for agreement approval
applications apply where the notification time for the agreement was on or after 6 June 2023. The genuine
agreement provisions in Part 2-4 of the FW Act, as it was just before 6 June 2023, continue to apply in relation
to agreement approval applications where the notification time for the agreement was before 6 June 2023. The
notification time for this Agreement was before 6 June 2023. Under transitional arrangements, amendments
made by Part 16 of Schedule 1 to the Amending Act in relation to the better off overall test requirements for
agreement approval applications apply where the agreement was made on or after 6 June 2023. This Agreement
was made after 6 June 2023.

PART B – EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS
ABORIGINAL & TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY
16.

The parties are committed to supporting a safe and inclusive workplace for Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander peoples and the following provisions reflect that commitment.
Cultural Safety

17.

The University will develop and implement an overarching policy to help ensure that the
University is a welcoming and culturally safe place for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples. This policy will be developed through a consultative process (including the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander staff and informed by the One Sydney Many People Strategy and Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Employment Plan 2022-2024, and in line with the University’s
governance structure. It will be in place within 12 months of the approval of this Agreement by
the Fair Work Commission.
Cultural and Ceremonial Leave

18.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff are entitled to up to seven days special paid leave to
attend to Indigenous cultural/ceremonial obligations. Staff will provide appropriate
documentation to their Supervisor and as reasonably requested.

19.

In addition to paid leave Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff may apply for an equal
amount of unpaid special leave to attend to Indigenous cultural/ceremonial obligations.
Approval of unpaid leave will be subject to reasonable business needs.
Consultation Procedures

20.

The University will establish and maintain an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander JCC. The
Committee will be established within 3 months of the approval of this Agreement by the Fair
Work Commission.

21.

The JCC will:
(a)

Consist of 8 people, with 50% of the composition nominated by the Unions.

(b)

Meet quarterly, and as reasonably requested by members of the Committee;

(c)

Engage where beneficial or necessary with external Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
Islander stakeholders;

(d)

Receive and provide commentary on reporting against general recruitment and
retention strategies such as targeted and identified positions, career progression for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff;

(e)

Monitor the progress of faculties, portfolios and Professional Staff Units towards the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment targets; Advise management on
the development of a University policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
matters, including employment practices and cultural safety, to ensure that the
University is a welcoming and culturally safe and welcoming place for Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples;

(f)

Assist in the development of an annual cultural safety survey of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Staff; and

(g)

Contribute to a summary report to all staff on the outcomes of the survey to the
University and staff and make recommendations to the Executive of matters to
improve cultural safety.

8

Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff Work
22.

The University recognises that the additional cultural load undertaken by Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander staff on behalf of the University enriches the institution and its commitment to
empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and communities.

23.

Therefore, where an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Staff member is called on by the
University to undertake or perform any additional cultural duties, these duties will be allocated
appropriate time in workloads, including within work plans, and considered in criteria for
promotion.

24.

An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employee is not obligated to undertake any requests
which involve additional cultural duties that are not part of their role.

25.

Staff on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander JCC will be provided with the time and
resources reasonably requested and approved by the University to prepare for the meetings
and consult with their colleagues
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Language Allowance

26.

27.

An employee who has recognised proficiency in any one of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islander languages and who is required by the University to use the language in the course of
their employment, will be paid:
(a)

Level 1 - $1500.00 per annum - Level 1 is an elementary level. This level of
proficiency is appropriate for all staff members in identified positions or staff who
are capable of using a minimal knowledge of language for the purpose of simple
communication;

(b)

Level 2 – $2800.00 per annum - Level 2 represents a level of ability for the ordinary
purposes of general business, conversation, reading and writing.

The level of proficiency and the approval for payment of this allowance will be reasonably
determined by the University in consultation with the staff member.
Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Employment Strategy

28.

Supported by matters set out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment Plan
2022-2024, the commitments set out in clauses 16 to 27 are designed to ensure that the
University is an attractive and safe place to work for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people and to improve recruitment and retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff.
The University will pursue a target to increase workforce participation of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples to population parity in the life of this Agreement. The parties note that
these numbers will change with time, but population parity is estimated by the ABS at
September 2022 to be 3.8% and based on end of year 2022 staffing numbers, parity would be
331 staff. The parties also recognise that achieving this target will be difficult and will pursue
the measures in clauses 16 to 32 to seek to achieve it.

29.

Informed by best practice, the University will adopt the following measures to support
achieving population parity and targets in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Employment Plan 2022-2024:
(a)

facilitating and encouraging the direct involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander staff members in determining their career strategies, goals and objectives,
including through the P&D Program;

(b)

developing specific means of increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
employment; and

(c)

adopting initiatives that increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees’
well-being and retention.

9

30.

The University will work to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees are:
(a)

increased across faculties, portfolios and professional staff units;

(b)

increased across HEO and academic Levels;

(c)

employed on types of contracts that are proportional to the wider University
community, that is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff will not be
predominantly employed in casual or fixed-term positions.

31.

Reports on the implementation of these measures and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Employment Plan will be provided to each meeting of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Joint Consultative Committee.

32.

As the University works towards the targets to increase indigenous workforce participation, if it
becomes apparent to management or either of the unions that targets will not be met, or
probably will not be met, the issues will be considered by the JCC taking into account the
above matters. The JCC will make recommendations to the University Executive as to what
measures need to be undertaken to ensure the targets will be met. The implementation of any
reasonable and agreed measures will be taken as compliance with the target.

EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION
33.

Staff will be provided with written confirmation of their employment category, classification,
duties, salary (or hourly/sessional rate in the case of Casual staff), whether the position is Fulltime, Part-time or casual and the name and position of their Supervisor. Part-time staff will
also be notified of the percentage of the full-time load to be worked. Casual staff will be
informed of the number of hours/sessions required or anticipated (where known), and the
provisions relating to conversion to Continuing or Fixed Term Employment. This information
will be provided on appointment and when changes occur. Staff will also receive fortnightly
statements of details of salary payments including gross salary, tax and other deductions,
superannuation, allowances, loadings and overtime payments. Such statements may be
issued in electronic form provided that alternative arrangements will be made for staff for
whom access to electronic statements is not readily available.
Note: Sessional rates only apply to Casual Academic and English language teaching staff.

contains a commencing date but no date or contingency upon which the contract will come to
an end.

FIXED TERM EMPLOYMENT
Definition
37.

Fixed Term employment means Full-time or Part-time employment for a specified term or other
ascertainable period under a contract that contains a starting date and an end date and/or a
contingency relating to a specified task or project and/or the continuation of a funding source,
upon which the contract will come to an end. A Fixed Term contract may be terminated before

Except where specified otherwise, provisions relating to salary (including incremental
progression), probation, termination of employment, leave and all other entitlements contained
in this Agreement apply to Fixed Term staff. Academic Staff may apply for promotion in
accordance with the University’s Academic Promotions Policy.

Further offers of employment and ending Fixed Term employment
40.

Except where a staff member is re-employed (on either a Fixed Term or Continuing basis) or
their employment is terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement, the staff member’s
employment will end on the specified end date or occurrence of the contingency specified in
the staff member’s contract of employment.

41.

A staff member employed for a Fixed Term with an end date will be notified in writing before
the end of their term, task or project:
(a)

whether the University proposes to retain the same position, or a substantially
similar position, for a further term; and

(b)

whether they will be offered a further term of employment.

42.

A staff member employed for a Fixed Term which includes a contingency will be notified in
writing before the contingency is invoked or occurs.

44.

If a decision about offering further employment cannot be made within the timeframes
specified in clause 43 due to uncertainty about the availability of funding to retain the position,
or for other operational reasons, the University will notify the affected staff member within the
timeframes specified in clause 43 to this effect, including the reason, and provide notification
in relation to further employment as soon as practicable thereafter.

45.

If the University decides to retain the same position or a substantially similar position for a

redeployment having been employed on a continuing basis immediately prior to the
commencement of their Fixed Term.

Delay of severance pay
48.

Where the University notifies a Fixed Term staff member in writing that further employment
may be offered within six weeks of the expiration of their Fixed Term, any severance payments
to which the staff member would be entitled may, in consultation with the staff member, be
deferred until either:
(a)

six weeks after the expiration of the staff member’s Fixed Term; or

14

(b)

the University notifies the staff member that no offer of further employment will be
made;

whichever occurs first.
49.

If further employment is offered, is accepted and commences within 6 weeks of the expiry of
the Fixed Term, the staff member’s employment will be regarded as Continuous Service and
the intervening period will be treated as a period of unpaid leave.

Conversion
50.

Fixed Term staff may apply for conversion to Continuing or Funding Contingent Continuing
employment in accordance with clause 81. The grounds on which the University may refuse
an application for conversion are in clause 84.

Tax treatment of severance pay
51.

Subject to compliance with taxation laws, severance payments made under clauses 46 and
58 will be treated as employment termination payments.

No discrimination against Fixed Term staff in applying for continuing positions
52.

Fixed Term staff are eligible to apply for continuing positions and will not be treated less
favourably than other categories of applicants on account of their Fixed Term status.

EXTERNALLY FUNDED FIXED TERM CONTRACT STAFF (INCLUDING CONTRACT RESEARCH
STAFF)
53.

Fixed Term contracts may be offered for Academic and Professional staff to perform work that
is Externally Funded. An Externally Funded Fixed Term contract may include a contingency in
addition to an end date.

54.

Where External Funding has been received for a specified term, the duration of the Fixed
Term contract will correspond with the term of the funding, or balance of the grant, from which
the position is funded, provided that there is sufficient funding and suitable work available for
the appointee. If there is a genuine operational reason for a Fixed Term contract for other than
the term of the funding then the Fixed Term appointment will be for the whole of the period the
specific work to be performed by the staff member is required.

55.

An appointee to an Externally Funded Fixed Term position may be employed on subsequent
Externally Funded contracts. A break between contracts of up to six months will not constitute
a break in continuity of service, but will not count as service for any purpose;

56.

Externally Funded Fixed Term contract staff who have worked at the University for over ten
years will be converted to Funding Contingent Continuing Employment on a case-by-case
basis, subject to having been assessed in accordance with the P&D Program as at least
meeting expected standards or satisfactory (as applicable), with defined objectives and key
performance indicators.

57.

A person who is not an existing staff member and who would otherwise be appointed to a
Fixed Term position under clause 38, may be offered employment at the University under a
Funding Contingent Continuing Employment contract to undertake Externally Funded work.

58.

Where a staff member is employed on a Funding Contingent Continuing Employment contract
and the relevant External Funding ceases for reasons outside the staff member’s control, and
the University is not able to redeploy the staff member or obtain suitable alternative
employment for them, the staff member’s employment will be terminated on grounds of
redundancy, and they will receive four weeks’ notice (or pay in lieu of notice) plus severance
pay in accordance with the scale set out at clause 46.

15

CASUAL EMPLOYMENT
Definition
59.

Casual staff means Professional staff who are employed and paid on an hourly basis or in the
case of Academic staff, on an hourly or sessional basis. Sessional employment may be for a
single session or a number of sessions over the course of one or more semesters.

60.

It is not the intention of the University to utilise casual or sessional employment to fill positions
of work that could reasonably be filled on a Continuing or Fixed Term basis or to increase
systematically the level of casual employment. During the life of this Agreement the University
will seek to reduce its use of casual and sessional employment and will provide annual reports
to the Joint Consultative Committee.

Employment arrangements and performance assessment
61.

Without limiting the University’s capacity to engage Casual staff generally:
(a)

Full-time and Part-time staff may also be engaged on a casual basis outside their
usual working hours to perform work other than their normal duties provided that the
arrangements are mutually agreed and there is no impact on their normal work; and

(b)

students of the University may be engaged on a casual basis.

62.

Casual employment should be on the basis of merit, and be transparent, competitive and
consistent with University policy.

63.

Casual Professional staff will be paid for a minimum of three hours per engagement except as
follows:
Work performed

Minimum
payment

Students performing work between Monday and Friday (except public
holidays) during the University’s main teaching weeks and any other day that
they are expected to attend the University in their capacity as students.
Retirees and persons with a primary occupation elsewhere (including with
the University).

One hour

Examination Supervisors (invigilators) and Assistants.
Persons engaged to perform work of a kind that is normally performed in
agricultural, engineering or associated industries.
Persons engaged to perform work of a kind normally performed in hospitality
industries, or nursing services.

Two hours

64.

Where an engagement of three hours or more is provided which can be performed
continuously, the staff member can be approved to perform that engagement split across a
day or days (rather than being limited to working the engagement continuously) at the request
of the staff member to meet a staff member's personal circumstances. This satisfies a three
hour minimum engagement. To avoid doubt, the splitting of the work is only at the request of
the staff member and a manager will not pressure a staff member to split the work.

65.

Engagements for Casual Academic staff will be as specified in Schedule 1.

66.

The performance of Professional Casual staff should be assessed in accordance with the P&D
Program after 12 months’ regular and systematic employment, and may also be assessed
after shorter periods of employment.
16

67.

The University will provide access to the necessary resources for Casual staff to perform the
work they are required to undertake.

68.

Casual staff who are employed on a regular and systematic basis will be eligible to claim up to
4 paid hours per annum, at times agreed with their Supervisor, to familiarise and update
themselves on University policies and procedures relevant to their engagement.

69.

If a casual staff member is directed by the University to undertake specific work, they will be
paid for the performance of that work at the appropriate rate.

70.

The University accepts the principle that all work allocated to Casual staff should be able to be
completed in the time allocated to undertake the work.

Casual service
71.

Except where expressly provided in this Agreement, periods of casual employment do not
count as service for the purpose of determining a staff member’s entitlement to any benefit
provided for under this Agreement which requires a minimum period of qualifying service or
which is determined on the basis of length of service.

Casual pay rates
72.

The rates of pay for Casual staff, and in the case of Casual Academic staff, the manner in
which they are to be applied (including rates in respect of all marking not contemporaneous
with a lecture, tutorial or other teaching session), are specified in Schedule 1. These rates
include a 25% loading in lieu of all forms of paid leave (other than long service leave under
clauses 273 to 284, industrial relations training leave under clause 564, and family and
domestic violence leave under clause 267 and paid special leave under clause 350)), paid
public holidays, notice of termination of employment and severance benefits. Where a Casual
staff member will be employed over an anticipated timeframe, the University may spread
payments equally over that timeframe. If the anticipated number of hours or sessions are not
worked, the Casual staff member’s payments will be adjusted accordingly.

73.

Casual academic staff will be paid for all work they are required to perform, in accordance with
Schedule 1.

74.

Casual academic staff must be engaged and paid for at least 2 hours of work on each
occasion they are required to attend work at the University, inclusive of any incorporated time
and payment for preparation or associated working time provided for in the pay rates set out in
Schedule 1.

75.

Casual academic staff have a right to request a review of hours allocated or where there is
non-allocation for required work, which will be conducted according to the process outlined in
Schedule 1.

Employment conditions applicable to Casual Academic Staff only
76.

To provide Casual Academic staff with increased certainty and security as to their
employment, appointments may be made to perform a specified program of work on a
sessional basis over an anticipated timeframe of one or more semesters. Casual Academic
staff employed on a sessional basis under this clause will receive a casual loading under
clause 72.

77.

Where for any reason it becomes necessary for the University to end a sessional arrangement
entered into under clause 76 before the end of a semester, the staff member concerned will
be given at least one week’s advance notification of the cessation of their employment. If the
staff member wishes to end their employment before the end of a semester, they will give the
University at least one week’s notice. The University may consent to a shorter period of notice
on a case-by-case basis. The University may substitute payment in lieu of all or any part of
any period of notice of termination or direct the staff member to not attend for duty. Payments

17

in lieu of notice will be calculated at the staff member’s Salary as at the date of cessation of
employment.
78.

Where a Casual staff member is employed to carry out work of the kind which is paid under
Schedule 1 (1), (2), (5), (6), (7) and because of illness is unable to deliver the face to face
component of the work, the staff member will be eligible to make a claim and will be paid under
Schedule 1 if their Supervisor is satisfied that the work was performed.

79.

The University will review the use of Casual teaching within each Faculty at the end of each
year. Where more than five per cent of a Faculty’s face-to-face teaching hours at Level B and
above is being performed by Casual staff (excluding staff who are students or who have other
primary occupations) for two consecutive semesters, the Faculty concerned will, as far as
operational needs permit, establish sufficient positions to bring the use of casual employment
within the five per cent threshold by the end of the following year.

80.

Casual Academic staff who have performed at least 60% of a Full-time teaching workload will
have access to Fixed Term or continuing education focused roles, subject to satisfying the
requirements in clause 123.

APPLICATIONS FOR CONVERSION TO CONTINUING OR FIXED TERM EMPLOYMENT
81.

82.

Fixed Term staff, excluding Fixed Term staff employed under Schedule 5, may apply for
conversion to Continuing or Funding Contingent Continuing Employment if they have:
(a)

been engaged to perform duties of a position, or a substantially similar position, for
at least the preceding 12 month period; and

(b)

been appointed on the basis of merit, through a transparent and competitive
process consistent with University policy, or served a minimum period of
employment of 24 months; and

(c)

matched performance and conduct expectations set and adopted during their
employment and evidenced in their most recent P&D Program and has been
assessed, for Academic staff, as at least meeting minimum standards, and for
Professional staff, as at least meeting most objectives (or equivalent) or satisfactory
(as applicable); and

(d)

demonstrated the capacity to meet the requirements of the converted position under
consideration.

Casual staff (including professional staff, teaching academic staff, and/or research staff),
excluding Casual staff employed under Schedule 5, may apply for conversion to Continuing,
Funding Contingent Continuing or Fixed Term employment if they have:
(a)

been engaged to perform duties of a position, or a substantially similar position, on
a regular and systematic basis for a number of hours over the preceding 12 month
period. An assessment of a regular and systematic work pattern will take into
account regular periods when work is not required such as during semester breaks
(to avoid ambiguity, a Casual Academic staff member undertaking similar teaching
hours over two full consecutive semesters meets the requirement to be regular and
systematic); and

(b)

been appointed on the basis of merit, through a transparent and competitive
process consistent with University policy, or served a minimum period of
employment of 24 months; and

(c)

matched performance and conduct expectations set and adopted during their
employment and, for Professional staff only, in the most recent P&D Program has
been assessed as at least meeting most objectives (or equivalent) or satisfactory
(as applicable); and

18

(d)

83.

demonstrated the capacity to meet the requirements of the converted position under
consideration.

A Casual staff member’s engagement arrangements or working hours must not be altered with
the intention to avoid obligations under clause 82.

Refusal of applications for conversion
84.

The University may refuse an application for conversion from a Fixed Term or Casual staff
member only on the following reasonable business grounds:
(a)

in the case of applications for Continuing employment the work is genuinely
temporary, for example it is predominantly related to discontinued, or discontinuing
programs or funding streams and in the case of applications for Funding Contingent
employment, the funding has been discontinued or will likely cease within a 12
month period;

(b)

there is insufficient revenue or funding streams to provide continuing support for the
staff member's employment. This ground does not apply where the substantive
work performed by the staff member applying for conversion will continue to be
required and would be performed by:
(i)

fixed term or casual staff; or

(ii)

permanent staff, and the ground has previously been used to deny the
individual conversion by shifting work to a permanent colleague;

(c)

the staff member has not matched performance and conduct expectations set and
adopted during their employment and has been assessed as not meeting expected
standards or unsatisfactory (as applicable) in the most recent P&D assessment;

(d)

the staff member cannot demonstrate the capacity to meet the requirements of the
converted position(s) under consideration. This ground will not apply where the
work requirements of the converted position will be the same or substantially the
same as those of the staff member's current position;

(e)

in the case of Casual staff only:
(i)

the staff member is a student, and their status as a student was the
primary reason for their appointment;

(ii)

the staff member is a genuine retiree; or

(iii)

the staff member has a primary role in the University, either as a full-time
or part-time staff member.

85.

The University will not allocate work, or restructure job requirements, with the intention to avoid
obligations under this clause.

86.

Applications for conversion under clauses 81 and 82 must be in writing to the relevant
Delegate, who will review the application and advise the staff member in writing of the
outcome within 30 days of receipt of an application.

87.

A staff member whose application for conversion is refused will be provided with written
reasons for the refusal.

88.

The staff member may make a further application for conversion after 12 months, or earlier if
the application was refused solely on the grounds in clause 84(a) and those grounds cease to
apply, or those grounds have not occurred within 26 weeks.

19

89.

A staff member whose application for conversion to continuing employment is refused solely
on the grounds in clause 84(a) will be offered Fixed Term employment provided they meet the
requirement of clause 38(b) for the remaining period that the work they are performing is
required.

90.

Nothing in this clause requires appointment to Fixed Term, where such appointment is not
permitted by law.

20

PART C: PROBATION AND CONFIRMATION
PROBATION
Employment on probationary basis
91.

Staff other than Casual staff may be employed on a probationary basis.

Probation period
92.

Staff appointed to Continuing or Fixed Term positions will be required to serve a probation
period as follows:
(a)

Academic staff other than Academic Fellows: 12 months;

(b)

Academic Fellows: two years;

(c)

Professional staff: six months.

A shorter period may be set having regard to the nature of the position and any other factors
the University considers relevant, including previous service with the University.
93.

A staff member's Supervisor should provide the staff member with initial feedback on their
performance no later than six months after commencing Academic employment and three
months after commencing Professional employment.

94.

At any time during the probation period, where a staff member’s performance or conduct is not
meeting the required standard they will be informed of the deficiencies in their performance or
conduct and the standards required of them. Where a staff member is at risk of having their
employment terminated in accordance with clause 97, they will be given written notification to
this effect. This clause does not preclude the University from terminating the employment of a
staff member in accordance with clause 97(b) without such prior written notification where
they have engaged in Serious Misconduct.

95.

For staff other than Academic Fellows, a probation period may be extended by up to
12 months in the case of Academic staff and three months in the case of Professional staff if
the staff member’s Supervisor considers that an extension is warranted because:

96.

(a)

the Supervisor has concerns about the staff member’s performance or conduct
during the initial probation period; or

(b)

the staff member has been absent from the workplace to such an extent that it has
not been possible to assess their performance during the initial probation period.

The successful completion of probation requires a P&D review of “meeting expected standards
of performance and conduct” or “satisfactory performance and conduct” (as applicable).

Termination of employment during probation
97.

At any time during the probation period, including any extended probation period, a staff
member’s employment may be terminated:
(a)

by the staff member or the University:
(i)

in the case of Academic staff employed on a Fixed Term contract the
specified term of which is for a period of less than 12 months, on
13 weeks’ written notice, or the balance of the term of employment,
whichever is the lesser;

(ii)

for all other academic appointments on a probationary basis, on
26 weeks’ written notice;
21

(b)

(iii)

in the case of Professional staff, on one week’s written notice; and

(iv)

in the case of English Language Teaching staff, on two weeks’ written
notice; or

by the University, without notice or payment in lieu of notice if the staff member has
engaged in Serious Misconduct.

98.

For Academic staff, the notice period in clause 97 will be taken to have commenced from the
date on which the staff member was given written notification under clause 94.

99.

The University may substitute payment in lieu of all or any part of any period of notice of
termination.

100.

The University must not terminate a staff member’s employment under clause 97 for reasons
relating to the staff member’s performance unless the staff member has been informed of, and
given an opportunity to address any deficiencies in their performance.

101.

The University must not terminate a staff member’s employment under clause 97(b) for
reasons relating to the staff member’s conduct unless the staff member has been informed of,
and given an opportunity to respond to, any adverse material about them on which the
University intends to rely.

CONFIRMATION – ACADEMIC STAFF ONLY
Confirmation period
102.

Academic staff appointed on a Continuing basis may be required to serve a confirmation
period of four years after the successful completion of probation.

103.

Academic staff appointed to an Academic Fellowship will be required to serve a confirmation
period of three years after the successful completion of probation.

104.

Except in cases of Serious Misconduct, a staff member whose performance or conduct is not
meeting the expected standard and who, as a result, is at risk of having their employment
terminated under clause 106 will be given a written notification to this effect. This clause does
not preclude the University from terminating a staff member’s employment under
clause 106(b) without such prior written notification where they have engaged in Serious
Misconduct.

105.

A confirmation period may be extended by up to twelve months if the staff member’s
Supervisor considers that an extension is warranted because:
(a)

the Supervisor has concerns about the staff member’s performance or conduct
during the initial confirmation period; or

(b)

the staff member has been absent from the workplace to such an extent that it has
not been possible to assess their performance during the initial confirmation period.

Termination of employment during confirmation period
106.

107.

At any time during the confirmation period, including any extended confirmation period, a staff
member’s employment may be terminated:
(a)

by the staff member or the University, on 26 weeks’ notice; or

(b)

by the University, immediately without notice or payment in lieu of notice if the staff
member has engaged in Serious Misconduct.

The notice period in clause 106 will be taken to have commenced from the date that the
written notification referred to in clause 104 was issued to the staff member.

22

108.

The University may substitute payment in lieu of all or any part of any period of notice of
termination.

109.

The University must not terminate a staff member’s employment under clause 106 unless they
have been informed of, and given an opportunity to respond to, any adverse material about
them on which the University intends to rely.

23

PART D: CLASSIFICATIONS, SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES
CLASSIFICATIONS AND CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTORS
110.

The levels/classifications and classification descriptors for all Academic and Professional Staff
to whom this Agreement applies (except for Trainees) are set out in Schedule 2, and English
Language Teaching classifications as set out in Schedule 5.

ACADEMIC STAFF ROLES
111.

Academic staff may be assigned to teaching and research, education focused or research only
roles. For clarity, staff appointed as PhD Fellows in accordance with clause 134 and
Professional practitioner roles in accordance with Schedule 8 are also members of academic
staff.

Education focused roles
112.

Education focused roles will be an option within a Faculty’s workload model to allow staff to
concentrate on teaching, learning, curriculum development, and scholarship in education.

113.

Provision for education focused roles will have regard to the personal and/or professional
circumstances and preferences of individual staff and will enable staff to be employed in
education focused work. Staff employed in education focused roles will have access to
promotion (taking into account teaching excellence, leadership and record of scholarship),
performance planning and development as well as a career path in teaching. Education
focused roles may be Full-time or Part-time.

114.

The parties support promoting measures to assist in ensuring parity of esteem, valuing
educational excellence and providing education focused career paths.

115.

Notwithstanding clause 386, a staff member engaged in an education focused role will have
(subject to clause 116):
(a)

a minimum allocation of 20% scholarship/research and 10% professional and
community engagement and administration; and

(b)

a maximum allocation for teaching and teaching related activities of 70%.

Additional workload support and oversight for education focussed workloads
116.

The University will provide staff appointed to education focused roles at Level A and B, (and
those education focused staff appointed at Level C who have not held a full-time position at a
university for at least 2 years), additional support. For those staff, the University will provide a
10 percentage point reduction in teaching load within the 70% teaching allocation for the first
two years of appointment. For clarity, this does not reduce the 70% percentage allocation for
teaching and teaching-related activities, it reduces the allocation of volume of teaching delivery
and associated preparation and assessment work within that allocation. A staff member who
can demonstrate on reasonable grounds that they need to continue a reduction in teaching
load in their 3rd year of employment, may request such a reduction through the Academic
P&D process and provide a rationale for that request. Approval of such a request by the
University will not be unreasonably denied.

117.

Workloads will be allocated in accordance with Part G - Workloads - Academic Staff Only.
The total hours of work that can be expected in any one week of Education focused staff must
be reasonable. Allocated work required to be performed in particular weeks and likely to result
in excessive hours must be avoided. Such circumstances can be addressed through the
mechanisms for addressing unreasonable workload allocations, including access to the
workload review panel in accordance with clauses 395 to 398.

118.

Monitoring of the increase in education focused roles and avoiding excessive workloads will be
supported by:

24

(a)

the Academic Workload Monitoring Committee monitoring the relevant workload
models, workload allocation concerns raised in respect of education focused roles
and any overall trends or issues identified through outcomes of education focused
role workload matters reviewed by the workload review panels in accordance with
clauses 395 to 398;

(b)

the Joint Consultative Committee (or sub-committee) receiving and considering
quarterly data about education focused roles, including information about
distribution of education focused appointees, workforce mix, levels and fraction of
education focused role appointees and considering any reports from the Academic
Workload Monitoring Committee about workload issues, where relevant.

Appointment to an education focused role
119.

A staff member employed in a teaching and research role may assume an education focused
role, either for an agreed and specific time period if agreed under clause 386 and then revert
to a teaching and research role, or on a continuing basis.

120.

The University may advertise for and engage a new staff member in an education focused
role. Nothing prevents an existing staff member from applying for such an advertised role.

121.

The University can employ staff in education focused roles to a limit of 25% of continuing and
fixed term academic staff (excluding research only staff and support staff), on an FTE basis.
The University will meet with the NTEU at least annually to report on the number of education
focused positions/roles (externally recruited and internally appointed), and the total number of
continuing and fixed term staff (excluding research only staff and support staff), in order that
the parties ensure the application of the 25% limit set above.

122.

A staff member who enters into a pre-retirement contract may be employed in an education
focused role on a Fixed Term basis.

123.

A staff member who has been employed as a Casual on a regular and systematic basis to
perform at least 60% of a full-time teaching workload, or would, but for this clause, be
employed on a Casual basis to perform at least 60% of a full-time teaching workload, will be
offered conversion to a Fixed Term position under clause 82 or a continuing position (as
determined by the University) in an education focused role, and regulated by clauses 112 to
126, subject to the following:
(a)

Fixed Term positions will be offered only if there is sufficient teaching work available
to require the position to be filled for a period of at least six months;

(b)

the staff member must demonstrate the capacity to meet the requirements of the
converted position under consideration; and

(c)

the staff member’s Casual employment was not to replace another staff member
who is absent on leave or temporary transfer, or is undertaking restricted duties, or
reduced working hours.

124.

The duration of any Fixed Term contract entered into under clause 123 must be no less than
six months and no more than two years.

125.

To assist in the career development of academic staff members in education focused roles,
the University will extend eligibility and relevant activities for the Special Studies Program to
include staff employed in education focused roles to undertake an approved program of work
to deepen their knowledge in relation to recent scholarship in their discipline and/or undertake
professional development opportunities to enhance their education expertise. Any requests for
the Special Studies Program will be considered in accordance with relevant University policy
and procedures.

25

Conversion to a teaching and research role
126.

127.

A staff member (other than a staff member who has entered into a pre-retirement contract)
who is employed in an education focused role under clause 120 or 123 and who has 4 years'
service in that role may apply to convert to a teaching and research role. The staff member
will be converted if the relevant Dean, and the DCV(E) or DCV(R) are satisfied that they have:
(a)

provided a calendar year's notice, as to proposed commencement of the teaching
and research role;

(b)

developed and agreed to undertake an annual research plan of work (using the
University’s performance plan template, and including provision for development
and mentoring);

(c)

had their research plan approved by their Supervisor and the Dean, Executive Dean
or Head of School and Dean (and such approval shall not unreasonably be
refused); and

(d)

met the teaching and research requirements, relative to opportunity, of a teaching
and research role.

Clause 126 does not preclude a staff member and the University agreeing at any time to
convert to a teaching and research role on agreed terms.

Academic Fellowships and Transition
128.

Any existing Academic Fellows employed at the commencement of this Agreement will
continue to be governed by the relevant provisions of the University of Sydney Enterprise
Agreement 2018-2021 while they remain in an Academic Fellow position.

Postgraduate Fellowships
129.

Students enrolled at the University on a Full-time or Part-time basis for a Masters or Doctoral
degree may be employed as postgraduate fellows for a specified term, provided that such term
must not exceed the maximum duration of their candidature. Subject to clause 130, a
postgraduate fellow’s employment will terminate on the specified end date of their contract or
immediately upon the cessation of their full-time or part-time enrolment as a postgraduate
student.

130.

A postgraduate fellow who successfully completes the requirements for their postgraduate
award course may remain in their position for the balance of the term of their contract.

131.

Nothing in clause 129 or 130 precludes the termination of a postgraduate fellow’s employment
in accordance with this Agreement.

132.

Postgraduate fellows will be employed in accordance with the following conditions:
(a)

workloads for postgraduate fellows will achieve a balance between the demands of
their fellowship and progress towards successful completion of their research
candidature consistent with the University’s policies relating to postgraduate studies
and research expectations. In doing so, a balance should be provided between
research expectations and a teaching load to achieve the strategic directions of the
University;

(b)

postgraduate fellows may be employed on a Part-time basis for up to 20 hours per
week to undertake research or teaching and related work; and

(c)

except where specified otherwise, provisions relating to leave and all other
entitlements except for severance pay contained in this Agreement apply to
postgraduate fellows on a pro rata basis.

26

PhD Fellows
133.

The appointment of PhD Fellows can assist in providing more secure employment than casual
engagements for a number of the University's PhD students, whilst also providing development
opportunities for the PhD Students. The fellowships are designed to support the development
and employability of PhD students as well as provide financial support whilst they study
without derogating from importance of the students achieving on-time completion of their PhD.

134.

The University may appoint PhD students to the position of Associate Lecturer (PhD Teaching
Fellow) (PhD Fellow). Appointments made over the life of the Agreement will not exceed
70FTE.

135.

Appointment to PhD Fellow positions:
(a)

is limited to students currently enrolled as PhD students at the University;

(b)

is subject to competitive merit-based selection based on the University's teaching
expectations;

(c)

is for a maximum of 3 years and for no less than 2 years;

(d)

is subject to prior discussion with their PhD supervisor; and

(e)

will typically be at a fraction of 0.2, but may be a lesser fraction in exceptional
circumstances by agreement.

136.

The employment as a PhD Fellow is conditional upon their continuing enrolment in their PhD
and will terminate on the specified end date of their contract or immediately upon earlier
cessation of their enrolment as a PhD student.

137.

Where reasonably required and agreed by the relevant supervisor, PhD Fellows may reduce
their teaching allocation in a semester for the purpose of assisting them to complete their PhD.

138.

Taking into account the demands of PhD candidature, a PhD Fellow will generally not be
permitted to perform additional teaching roles (whether casual or otherwise). This does not
preclude, in exceptional circumstances, capacity for the PhD Fellow to be approved to
undertake some additional casual teaching work and subject to ensuring that their PhD
Candidature and PhD Fellowship roles are not adversely impacted. Approval will be required
from the relevant Head of School after consultation with the PhD Fellow and their research
supervisor.

139.

In relation to allocation of workload:
(a)

the role is for teaching and teaching-related activities (and noting their research is
undertaken as part of their PhD candidature);

(b)

over each 12 month period, PhD Fellows will undertake teaching and teaching
related duties for the equivalent fraction (eg 0.2) of a full time academic workload
allocation, normally concentrated in specific teaching periods, provided that there
will be an allocation of a minimum of 10% of their workload for general
administration and general contribution to the School/Faculty, on the basis that they
will not have significant administrative load or expectations. This is separate to their
activities as part of their PhD candidature and normal expectations of a PhD
student;

(c)

workloads will be determined on a fair, transparent and consultative basis;

(d)

in allocating workload the University will use the equivalent of the casual academic
staff calculations in the allocation of hours for teaching (eg for tutorials);

(e)

clauses 370 to 379, 386, and 389(a) do not apply to PhD Fellows; and

27

(f)

a PhD fellow can seek a review of their workload in accordance with clauses 395 to
398.

Professional Practitioners
140.

The University may employ Professional Practitioners in accordance with Schedule 8.

Reduced reliance upon casual academic employment and investment in continuing staff
20% reduction
141.

The University will take all reasonable steps to achieve a 20% reduction in the proportion of
the casual academic workforce (on a FTE basis comparative to the total FTE academic
workforce (but excluding in each case all research only staff and support staff) over the 3 year
period following commencement of the Agreement. For the purposes of this clause, casual
staff who also have a concurrent non-casual appointment with the University are also excluded
from these calculations. The calculations will be based upon the figures reported to the DESE
(with initial figures based upon those reported to DESE for 2022 as published on the University
intranet). The reduction will be reasonably proportional across the period of the Agreement.
Increase in roles for continuing staff

142.

143.

The University has committed to increasing continuing academic positions, including both
continuing teaching and research positions and continuing education focused positions as
follows. Over the 3 year period following commencement of the Agreement, the University will
advertise 330 new continuing academic positions (over and above existing filled positions and
existing vacant positions). The 330 positions will include:
(a)

110 teaching and research academic positions;

(b)

220 education focused positions, which can include some positions at levels D and
E to assist in the educational leadership that will help promote teaching excellence
and parity of esteem.

The positions will be determined by the University, taking into account the needs of the
academic areas (including prioritising areas with the highest levels of casual employment).
The positions will be advertised reasonably proportionately across the period of the
Agreement.
Priority for existing eligible staff

144.

25% of the new education focused positions created in accordance with clause 142 will be
specifically designated to be filled by long term casual and fixed term staff (being staff with
more than 2 years casual or fixed term employment with the University of Sydney, who have
not had a continuing appointment in the last 5 years) (Eligible Staff).

145.

Those Eligible Staff will be prioritised to apply first and will need to be able to demonstrate that
they meet the essential requirements for the positions. If there is more than one application
from Eligible Staff for those roles, the appointment will be on competitive merit.

146.

50% of the new teaching and research positions created in accordance with clause 142 will be
specifically designated to be filled by existing Eligible Staff. These roles will be:
(a)

teaching and research roles with a 40% research/scholarship allocation (ie
40:40:20);

(b)

provided with support, as early career staff;

(c)

can be at level A or B and at a minimum of level A step 6 for PhD qualified staff;
and

28

(d)

147.

subject to the standard confirmation processes, including 12 month probation
check, and 4 year confirmation process, after which a successful staff member will
be confirmed in the continuing teaching and research role. Provided that if they do
not meet the confirmation requirements for the teaching and research role, but are
assessed as meeting the requirements for an education focused role, then they
may be offered confirmation in an education focused role.

Casual academic staff are encouraged to apply and will be considered on merit for any and all
other roles.
Force Majeure

148.

If there are exceptional and unanticipated adverse impacts upon the University's financial
circumstances (substantial adverse changes in Government funding, significant adversely
changed economic circumstances and significant reduction in student enrolments), the
obligations in clause 142 will not apply and the University and NTEU shall consult in relation to
adjusting that commitment.

PROFESSIONAL STAFF CLASSIFICATION ASSESSMENT
Classification principles
149.

Professional staff positions will be classified in accordance with the Professional staff
classification descriptors set out in Schedule 2. Positions will be classified at the level which
most accurately reflects the work to be performed, taking into account the duties and
responsibilities of the position.

150.

The following general principles apply to classification assessment:
(a)

all positions are subject to these procedures, regardless of funding source or
availability;

(b)

the classification assessment will be of the position not the occupant;

(c)

classification assessment decisions will be based only on an assessment of the
documentation of positions against the classification descriptors in Schedule 2; and

(d)

equity principles and the classification descriptors will be applied consistently
across positions.

Classification assessment process
151.

Classification assessment will be undertaken by the University’s classification assessment
team, which will be led by a specialist, nominated by the University, who can consider and
validate the attributes of the position against the position assessment descriptors. The
classification assessment team will also conduct position description surveys University-wide
every two years and report the results to a Classification Monitoring Panel (CMP).

152.

The CMP will comprise:
(a)

three staff appointees, being Professional staff nominated by the staff
representatives on the Joint Consultative Committee; and

(b)

three management appointees, being staff nominated by the University.

The CMP will be responsible for:
(a)

reviewing the classification assessment statistical profile bi-annually; and

(c)

determining disputes relating to position descriptions and applications for
classification reassessment.
29

The head of the classification assessment team will provide training to members of the CMP in
the principles and processes of classification monitoring. For the purposes of determining
disputes relating to applications for classification reassessment, the CMP will be supplemented
by a pool of suitably qualified staff and external appointees who will be appointed by the
University (in consultation with the Unions through the Joint Staff Consultative Committee) to
act as Chairpersons.
Professional staff position descriptions
153.

Each Professional staff position will have a position description which will include the purpose
of the position and its overall context within the workplace; the duties required of the position;
the degree of task complexity; the scope for decision-making; the level of knowledge,
experience and skills required; and the relationship of the position to other positions within the
team or work group. From time to time, where either the Supervisor or the staff member
consider there is a need to review the staff member’s position description to ensure it
continues to accurately reflect the requirements of the position, they will meet and discuss the
requirements of the position. If agreement cannot be reached the matter may be referred to
the CMP in accordance with clause 158.

154.

Where a staff member has been performing particular duties for six months or more with the
knowledge of their Supervisor, those duties will be deemed to have been required for the
period during which they were performed. If these duties are required to be performed beyond
six months on an ongoing basis, the position description will be updated.

155.

Where substantial changes have been made to the duties or responsibilities of a Professional
staff position, the position description will be reviewed and updated. The classification
assessment team will then undertake classification assessment of the updated position
description in accordance with the classification assessment process outlined in clause 151.

156.

Position descriptions must be approved by the authorised Delegate at the Faculty/School or
work unit level. A staff member who does not agree that their position description accurately
describes their role, may, after seeking to resolve the matter with the relevant Delegate, refer
the matter to the CMP.

157.

Disputes relating to position descriptions referred to the CMP will be dealt with in the first
instance by two CMP members (one staff nominee and one management nominee), and any
matter that remains unresolved will be referred to the CMP for resolution.

Classification reassessment process
158.

A staff member or their Supervisor or Union may apply for a reassessment of the classification
of the staff member’s position once during any 12 month period.

159.

Applications for classification reassessment will be determined by the University’s
classification assessment team, and should normally be determined within six weeks of the
date of lodgement unless an extension is approved by a sub-committee of the CMP which will
be established for this purpose. If an application for reassessment is not determined by the
classification assessment team within six weeks of being lodged (or such longer period as may
be approved by the CMP sub-committee), the applicant may ask the CMP to determine the
application.

160.

Where a decision is taken to upgrade a position to a higher level, the effective date of the
reclassification will be the date on which the changes that warranted the upgrading occurred.

161.

Where a decision is taken to not approve the application for a change in classification to a
higher level, the Head of the classification assessment team will provide the incumbent and
the Supervisor of the position with written reasons for the decision.

162.

Where a position is assessed as being at a lower classification than its present level, the
Classification Assessment team will provide the incumbent and the Supervisor of the position
with written reasons for the decision. Whilst the staff member remains in this position, the

30

incumbent will remain entitled to salary at the HEO level they were at prior to reclassification
and retain access to incremental progression and future Agreement increases.
Classification appeals
163.

A staff member may appeal to the CMP against a determination of the classification
assessment team.

164.

Appeals must be lodged within 14 days of notification of the decision and must specify how the
process of decision making was flawed and/or the grounds on which the classification
assessment decision was in error.

165.

Appeals will be determined by an appeal panel convened from the membership of the CMP
comprising one staff appointee, one management appointee and a Chairperson.

166.

The CMP will determine the merits of the classification assessment decision on the basis of
whether the descriptors have been correctly applied, and may make its determinations on the
basis of written submissions only or to conduct a meeting to review the written submissions.

the staff member’s Salary only. For all other matters, Staff engaged under the SWS will be
entitled to the same terms and conditions of employment as other staff covered by the
Agreement, on a pro rata basis.

Incremental progression
180.

181.

On completion of twelve months’ paid service, Continuing and Fixed Term staff (other than
staff who are paid at the highest salary step applicable to their classification level) will be
eligible for advancement to the next salary step within their classification level if their
performance has been assessed under the University’s P&D Program as meeting most
objectives or satisfactory (as applicable). A decision to withhold a salary increment must be
authorised by the relevant Supervisor. If incremental progression is withheld or deferred, the
staff member will be notified in writing of the reasons and given the opportunity to respond.
For the purpose of clause 180 only, the following periods will not be excluded when
determining whether a staff member has completed 12 months' paid service:
(a)

all periods of unpaid parental leave taken in accordance with clauses 291 to 292 of
the Agreement; and

Recognition of service increments when changing jobs
182.

A staff member who moves to a different position that is similar in tasks and skills required, at
the same HEO Level, will retain their incremental position on the HEO Level.

Allowances
183.

Allowances (other than higher duties allowances for Professional staff) will be paid to eligible
staff in accordance with Schedule 3. Except as specified in Schedule 3, the allowances listed
in that schedule will be increased during the term of this Agreement in accordance with the
percentage increases specified in clause 168 at the times specified in that clause.

Higher duties – Professional staff only
184.

Professional staff may be required to act temporarily in a position that is classified at a higher
level than their substantive position. Subject to clauses 185 to 187, staff required to act in a
higher position for a continuous period of five working days or more will be paid as follows:

33

(a)

if required to perform the full range of duties of the position in which they are
required to act, the minimum Salary rate applicable to the classification of the acting
position; and

(b)

in other cases the amount payable will be an allowance determined by the
University having regard to factors such as the duties that the staff member is
required to perform and the staff member’s performance, including during previous
periods of temporary performance and relevant experience or skills.

185.

Staff seconded or transferred to a position which is classified at a higher level than their
substantive position in accordance with clause 184 will not be eligible to be paid in
accordance with clause 184. They will instead receive the substantive salary for the role.

186.

If a staff member has been acting in a higher position for a continuous period of 12 months
and is able to satisfy the criteria for incremental progression:

187.

(a)

the payment will be increased to the next incremental step within the higher
classification level if the staff member is required to perform the full range of duties
of the position in which they are required to act; and

(b)

in other cases, the allowance will be increased by an amount reflecting the
percentage of the duties required to be performed.

A staff member whose substantive responsibilities as specified in their position description (or
equivalent) include deputising for a more senior staff member will not be entitled to any
allowance when deputising for the senior staff member.

Payment of salaries and related payments
188.

Salaries, allowances and overtime payments will be paid fortnightly by electronic funds transfer
into a financial institution account nominated by the staff member.

189.

Any other payments to which a staff member may be entitled, whether under this Agreement
or otherwise, will also be made by electronic funds transfer into a financial institution account
nominated by the staff member.

190.

Where a staff member receives an amount to which they are not entitled (an overpayment),
the amount of any overpayment:
(a)

can be applied by the University to meet any future payment obligation to the staff
member, provided that the University has informed the staff member of the
overpayment and the reason(s) it occurred and consulted them about arrangements
for its recovery, including, for example, recovery by instalments over an agreed
term; and

(b)

to the extent that any overpayment exceeds the University’s future payment
obligations to the staff member, the staff member must reimburse the overpaid
amount to the University within 28 days of being requested to do so, or at such
other time(s) that the University may agree, including, for example, payment by
instalments over an agreed term.

SUPERANNUATION
191.

Subject to clauses 191 to 196, the University will make superannuation contributions for all
continuing and fixed-term staff at the rate of 17% of their superannuable salary.

192.

All other staff will be entitled to employer superannuation contributions at the minimum rate
provided for in the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992 (SG Act).

193.

To the extent permitted by law the University will nominate UniSuper as the superannuation
fund for new staff and UniSuper is the default fund for this Agreement. If the scheme to which

34

a staff member belongs requires them to make employee contributions, such contributions
must be made from the staff member’s salary.
194.

If a staff member has chosen a superannuation fund which does not accept a 17% employer
superannuation contribution, the University will pay the highest allowable contribution up to
17%.

195.

For staff who are members of the State Superannuation Scheme or the State Authorities
Superannuation Scheme (the State Schemes), the University will make employer
superannuation contributions to the State Scheme to which the staff member belongs in
accordance with the relevant employer contribution levels and arrangements in place
immediately prior to the commencement of this Agreement provided the staff member is
eligible to have employer superannuation contributions made on their behalf to their State
Scheme and elects to do so.

196.

Nothing in this clause limits the University from exercising flexibilities in the superannuation
arrangements and contribution rates by agreement between the University and a staff member
where those flexibilities are provided for in the UniSuper Superannuation Trust Deed and/or
the Deed of Covenant, as amended from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this
includes the 5% flexibility in coverage and contribution level.

197.

The University will provide access to UniSuper’s digital choice of superannuation form and
access to information about UniSuper when making an offer of employment.

REMUNERATION PACKAGING
198.

Staff may enter remuneration packaging arrangements in accordance with University policy.
Any termination payments and payments in lieu of leave payable to a staff member will be
calculated on the basis of the Salary which would be payable had they not taken benefits in
lieu of Salary.

35

HEO Level 9 or below, the additional hours are paid at the overtime rates specified
in Schedule 4.

Additional hours worked up to the ordinary weekly hours of an equivalent Full-time staff
member count as service for all purposes.

SEASONAL, PART-YEAR AND ANNUALISED EMPLOYMENT – PROFESSIONAL STAFF ONLY
203.

Professional staff may be employed on a seasonal, part-year or annualised employment basis
to work an agreed pattern of hours incorporating a combination of Full-time service and/or
Part-time service and periods during which no work is required. Such arrangements may be
made for employment on a Continuing or Fixed Term basis.

arrangements and/or permanent arrangements. To access flexible working arrangements (c)
through (k) above, eligible staff must apply in writing to their Supervisor, setting out the nature
and duration of the arrangements they are seeking. No pressure will be put on a staff member
to enter into a flexible working arrangement.

210.

If an application for a flexible working arrangement is agreed to by the University, staff
members retain the right to revert to their working arrangements immediately before
commencing the flexible working arrangement, at the end of an agreed period. Staff may also
request a return to their former working arrangements during the agreed period of the flexible
working arrangement where their circumstances change.

211.

The University must genuinely consider the application including any alternative proposals
submitted by the staff member, and taking into account the urgency of the request will provide
a written response as soon as possible, but in any event within 21 days, stating whether the
University grants or refuses the request. The University will take reasonable steps to
accommodate the request.

212.

The University will support the flexible working arrangement wherever reasonably possible and
applications will not be unreasonably refused. In considering what is reasonably possible, the
University will take into account the benefit to the staff member, whether it is reasonably
possible to meet the operational requirements and the flexible working arrangement does not
significantly impact upon other staff. If an application is refused, the University will provide

37

detailed reasons to the staff member. If an application is refused, the University will also
explore possible alternative options submitted by the staff member.
213.

214.

In the event of multiple applications for flexible working arrangements, the University may give
priority to applications in the following circumstances (not in any order of priority):

Information regarding the right to request a Flexible Working Arrangement will be provided
during on-boarding and will be available on the staff intranet.

Working Remotely
215.

Whilst staff are employed to undertake their roles at the University, all Professional Staff may,
with agreement of their supervisor, work remotely. Remote working will not be unreasonably
refused and will be supported where:
(a)

the staff member is able to satisfactorily complete the requirements of their role split
across the periods in which they are working remotely and in attendance at
campus;

(b)

there are certain functions, activities or duties that can only be performed on
campus, the staff member attends on campus to perform those functions, activities
or duties;

workplace health and safety requirements are able to be met; and

(e)

the needs of the local work unit are able to be met and the arrangement does not
unreasonably impact upon other staff.

subject to the relevant appeal processes in the Review of Actions and Decisions and Dispute
Settling Procedures in Part N: Consultation, Dispute Resolution and Union
Representation of this Agreement.

The University will facilitate working remotely to the extent that it reasonably can. This may
include:
(a)

ensuring that staff are provided laptop computers upon request rather than
desktops;

(b)

staff have access to meetings via on-line systems; and

38

(c)

other matters that can be reasonably catered.

will be as per the Flexible Working Arrangements Policy as updated from time to time.

219.

A staff member who works both remotely and on campus (i.e. in a hybrid manner) will have
access to a campus workspace.

220.

From time to time the University may direct employees to perform their role remotely or in a
hybrid manner. Where this occurs, the University will provide the relevant resources for the
staff member to perform their duties.

Flexibility for Staff with Disabilities
221.

In determining availability of access to Flexible Working Arrangements for staff with disabilities,
the University will meet reasonable costs in catering for the flexibility. This will include
providing appropriate resources for the staff member as reasonably determined by the
University.

Intercampus Work and Travel
222.

If staff are required to travel between campuses during their hours of work, the University will
determine the most suitable mode of transport in consultation with the staff member, which
may include a University owned vehicle, and any costs incurred in such travel will either be
reimbursed upon production of receipts, or will be covered by other local arrangements, in
accordance with the University’s procedures. Travelling time that is required between
campuses during a staff member’s hours of work is regarded as time worked.

223.

If a staff member is required to collect or return a University vehicle from one University
location to travel to another University location, the travel time between campuses will be
counted as time worked even if outside the staff member’s standard hours.

224.

If a staff member is required to commence or finish work at a different campus to their usual
place of work, any increased travel time will be regarded as time worked.

Right to Disconnect
225.

The University does not expect staff covered by this Agreement to monitor or respond to
communications from the University outside their normal working hours and periods of
approved leave (including concessional days) except where there is an urgent operational
need identified or an emergency circumstance, or pursuant to a relevant clause of this
Agreement (such as on-call arrangements or authorised overtime).

39

PART F: PUBLIC HOLIDAYS, CONCESSIONAL DAYS AND LEAVE
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND CONCESSIONAL DAYS
226.

Staff (other than Casual staff) are entitled to be absent from work on the following public
holidays and will be paid for those days at their ordinary rate of pay:
(a)

New Year’s Day, Australia Day, Good Friday, Easter Saturday, Easter Monday,
Anzac Day, Queen’s Birthday, Labour Day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day or any days
proclaimed as substitute days and all other public holidays that are proclaimed as
state-wide holidays for the State of New South Wales.

(b)

Provided that nothing in this clause prevents the University from requesting a staff
member to work on a public holiday; however, the staff member may refuse the
request if it is not reasonable, or the refusal is reasonable.

227.

To support staff who do not wish to observe the Australia Day Public Holiday on 26 January,
the University and a staff member may agree to substitute the Australia Day public holiday for
the working day prior to or following that public holiday.

228.

The first working day after the Boxing Day public holiday will also be treated as a public
holiday, in lieu of the August Bank Holiday, and four additional days in conjunction with the
Christmas and New Year public holiday will be designated as concessional days, for which
staff (other than Casual staff) who are not required to work will be paid at their ordinary rate of
pay.

229.

Part-time staff who would normally have worked on a particular day but for the occurrence of a
public holiday or concessional day will be paid for the proportion of time that they would
normally have worked.

230.

A Professional staff member who works on a public holiday at the request of the University will
be paid double time and one half of their ordinary rate of pay for the hours worked. This
payment will be instead of any loading payable under clause 14 of Schedule 4. A
Professional staff member who works on a concessional day at the request of the University
will be paid their ordinary rate of pay for the hours worked and will be entitled to time in lieu at
the ordinary rate for the hours worked.

Requirements to Work on Concessional Days
231.

Where the University requires staff members to work on concessional days, management will
ensure that volunteers from the relevant work area are called for in the first instance, and the
work is allocated to suitable volunteers before non-volunteers are required to work. The
University will provide reasonable notice (normally 6 weeks) if a staff member is required to
work on concessional days.

232.

A staff member who works on a concessional day at the request of the University will be paid
for the hours worked, and be entitled to take a concessional day in lieu at a time mutually
agreed with their Supervisor. This day in lieu could be appended to other leave and public
holidays.

ANNUAL LEAVE
233.

Subject to clause 234:
(a)

staff (other than Casual staff and seven day continuous shift-workers) will be
entitled to four weeks’ paid annual leave; and

(b)

seven day continuous shift-workers (other than Casual staff) will be entitled to five
weeks’ paid annual leave for each 12 months of continuous paid service, accruing
on a pro rata basis.

40

234.

Annual leave does not accrue during any period of leave without pay, and accrues on a pro
rata basis during any period of paid leave taken at less than full pay. Staff will be paid at their
ordinary rate of pay for any public holiday falling during their annual leave without deduction
from their leave credits.

235.

Seven day shift-workers will not be paid shift loadings for public holidays occurring during a
period of annual leave.

236.

To ensure that applications and rejections of applications can be accurately tracked, all
requests for annual leave should be initiated through WorkDay or any replacement system.

237.

The University may have restricted leave periods for work units where due to demand it is
reasonable to have them. The use of these limited leave periods will be limited to times of
demonstrable high work demand and will only be implemented after consultation with staff.

238.

Annual leave makes an important contribution to the health and well-being of staff, and annual
leave plans for each staff member will be included in workload planning. Annual leave will be
taken at times approved by the University, and may be taken in one consecutive period, or in
shorter separate periods by mutual agreement. The University will not unreasonably refuse an
application for leave. As far as practicable, the University will consider the preferences of staff
in relation to the scheduling of leave.

239.

Staff may accumulate up to 40 days’ annual leave entitlement. Where a staff member has
accrued more than 40 days annual leave, they may be directed to take annual leave under
clause 240(c) or elect to cash out up to 10 days annual leave under clause 242.

240.

Staff may be directed to take annual leave or be considered to be on annual leave in the
following circumstances:
(a)

Staff may be directed to take a minimum of 10 days’ annual leave within a calendar
year at a time convenient to the University, which leave must be taken in one
continuous period.

(b)

Staff may be directed to take annual leave during the usual period of annual close
down in December/January for working days other than public holidays (including
any days proclaimed as substitute public holidays) and any additional concessional
days* granted by the University falling within the close down period.
*See clauses 226 and 228.

241.

(c)

A staff member who, at 30 September of any year, has accrued in excess of 36
days annual leave, will receive notification that their annual leave balance will
exceed 40 days on 1 January the following year, unless the annual leave is taken.
If the annual leave is not taken, the staff member will be directed to take, and
considered to be on annual leave from the staff member's first expected working
day after 1 January for the period of leave in excess of 40 days, unless, over the
preceding year, reasonable requests for annual leave have been denied.

(d)

Before being considered to be on annual leave under clause 240(c) a staff member
must have been:
(i)

advised to take annual leave;

(ii)

notified in writing that they will be deemed to be on leave if not taken by
1 January; and

(iii)

given the opportunity to take the excess leave.

Clause 240(c) does not apply to a staff member who has obtained approval from their
Supervisor and the Delegated Officer (Staffing) to take the leave over a longer period, which
may be up to a maximum of 12 months.

41

242.

To assist staff with excess annual leave, including due to previous impacts of COVID limiting
leave opportunities, staff who have accrued more than 40 days annual leave may elect to cash
out annual leave as follows:
(a)

a staff member can cash out a maximum of 10 days over the life of the Agreement;

(b)

leave may be cashed out only if the staff member takes an amount of annual leave
equal to or greater than that cashed out;

(c)

the staff member must have a minimum of 4 weeks leave remaining after the
cashing out and taking an equivalent period of annual leave;

(d)

an election to cash out leave must be in writing, agreed between the staff member
and the University;

(e)

the cash out payment will be made at the time that leave under clause 241(b) is
taken; and

(f)

the University will not pressure staff to cash out leave and encourages staff to take
annual leave.

243.

If a staff member has exercised the right to cash out leave or has been given a direction to
take leave, the University will be entitled to deduct the amount of annual leave from the staff
member’s accrued leave credits.

244.

Staff with insufficient accrued annual leave to cover the specified annual leave days during any
period of annual close down will take leave without pay for the days on which they would have
otherwise been directed to take annual leave. However, Professional staff who have
insufficient accrued annual leave to cover the specified annual leave days but have accrued
additional time under clause 12 of Schedule 4, may utilise their accrued hours instead of
taking unpaid leave.

245.

Staff are normally expected to take all their accrued leave prior to the end of their employment
with the University.

Interaction with personal leave
246.

A staff member who is ill or incapacitated during annual leave, may, on production of
acceptable documentation as defined in clauses 271(a) and 271(b) take personal leave for
the period of their illness or incapacity, and the annual leave deducted will be re-credited to the
extent of personal leave approved.

Payment in lieu of accrued annual leave
247.

Staff will be paid in lieu of any annual leave that is accrued but untaken at the time of
termination of their employment. Such payments will be calculated at the staff member's
Salary as defined in clause 3 in relation to paid leave and payments in lieu of leave. If a staff
member dies, the payment will be paid to their estate unless otherwise required by law.

ANNUAL LEAVE LOADING
248.

Staff (other than Casual staff and seven day continuous shift-workers) will receive an annual
leave loading payment in December each year. Subject to clauses 249 to 252 the loading will
be equivalent to 17.5% of four weeks’ pay at the staff member’s Salary rate as at
30 November immediately preceding the payment date.

249.

The maximum loading payable will be equivalent to 17.5% of four weeks’ pay at the Salary
rate applicable to the base of Higher Education Officer Level 10 (for Professional and English
Language Teaching staff) and Level C, step 3 for Academic staff at 30 November immediately
preceding the payment date.

42

250.

Staff whose employment ends before the December payment date or who have not completed
12 months Continuous Service as at 31 December of the year to which the payment relates
(the accrual year), will receive a pro rata payment based on the number of completed months
of Continuous Service in the accrual year provided that no payment shall be made to staff
whose employment is terminated on grounds of Serious Misconduct.

251.

Seven day continuous shift-workers will be paid the greater of:

252.

(a)

the shift penalties (or other allowances paid in lieu of shift penalties) that they would
have received had they not been on annual leave; or

(b)

a loading equivalent to 17.5% of four weeks’ pay, to be calculated at the lesser of:
(i)

the staff member's Salary rate as at 30 November immediately
preceding the payment date; or

(ii)

the Salary rate applicable to the base of Higher Education Officer Level
10 (for Professional and English Language Teaching staff) and Level C,
step 3 for Academic staff at 30 November immediately preceding the
payment date.

Payment will be made in December each year, or on the date any final termination payment is
made.

PERSONAL LEAVE
253.

Staff (other than Casual staff) will be entitled to paid personal leave as follows:
(a)

on commencement of employment staff are credited with 2 weeks paid personal
leave;

(b)

each year on the anniversary of their employment, staff are credited with 10 weeks
paid personal leave.

254.

Any leave credited under clause 253(a) or 253(b) above but not taken in the 12 months period
after it is credited is added to a staff member’s entitlement on the next anniversary of their
employment and remains to their credit for a further 12 months only.

255.

Any leave credited under clause 253(a) or 253(b) above assumes that the staff member will
complete 12 months Continuous Service in the 12 months following the credit date. If the staff
member does not complete 12 months Continuous Service (for example, they take a period of
unpaid leave), or they change the percentage of their full-time equivalent load worked during
the period until the next credit date, the leave will be adjusted accordingly.

256.

The entitlement under clause 253 is inclusive of the entitlement to 10 days’ personal leave per
year under the National Employment Standards under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (NES
Component). Any leave taken (other than under clause 258(h) or 258(i)) will first be debited
from the NES Component.

257.

Any untaken NES Component will continue to accrue from year to year. A staff member’s
personal leave entitlement will be the greater of clause 253 or the NES entitlement.

258.

Subject to available credits, staff may take paid personal leave in the following circumstances:
(a)

where they are unable to attend work due to personal illness or injury and do not
receive workers' compensation payments in respect of the absence (sick leave);

(b)

to care for a member of their Immediate Family or household who is ill or
incapacitated and requires care and support, or who requires care due to an
unexpected emergency, in which case a staff member is entitled to 10 days leave

43

per year of service (accruable for the purposes of this subclause 253(b)) less any
carers leave previously taken;
(c)

for menstrual or menopausal reasons;

(d)

to access In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) and other forms of assisted reproductive health
services;

(e)

gender affirmation and transition, to be used after the specific gender transition and
affirmation leave is exhausted;

(f)

the staff member has a premature baby requiring special care as set out in
clause 298;

(g)

where a cessation of pregnancy occurs prior to 20 weeks gestation;

(h)

Professional staff may convert up to five days of their accrued personal leave each
year (other than the NES Component) to career development leave under
clause 333 (career development leave); and

(i)

where the staff member’s partner has given birth to a child or the staff member has
adopted a child, or been granted a permanent care order, in which case up to ten
days personal leave may be taken within 12 months of the birth or adoption in
addition to clause 300(b) (paid Partner Leave).

259.

If a public holiday as defined in clause 226, falls during a period during which the staff
member has taken paid personal leave, the staff member is taken not to be on paid personal
leave on that public holiday unless they would have otherwise been required to work on that
day.

260.

No payment will be made in lieu of unused personal leave on termination of employment.

261.

Additional paid personal leave may be approved by the Delegated Officer (Staffing) in
exceptional circumstances where a staff member has used up all of their paid personal leave
entitlement and is suffering substantial hardship and:
(a)

the staff member or a member of their Immediate Family for whom they have caring
responsibilities is seriously ill or injured;

(b)

the staff member is affected by Family and Domestic Violence; or

(c)

the staff member has used up their paid personal leave due to taking a majority of
their leave for the purposes in clauses 258(c) to 258(g).

262.

Staff with shared responsibility for the care of a family member may not access this entitlement
on the same day or days, unless they can demonstrate exceptional circumstances to the
University's satisfaction.

263.

To assist staff with family responsibilities, a Supervisor may agree to them:
(a)

taking up to two weeks annual leave in single days;

(b)

taking accrued time off in lieu of overtime;

(c)

taking unpaid leave or undertaking additional work to make up for time taken to care
for a family member who is ill or incapacitated; and/or

(d)

entering into flexible working arrangements under clauses 206 to 213.

44

Casual staff
264.

265.

Subject to providing notification and medical certificates or other documentation as specified in
clause 271, Casual staff are entitled to not be available to attend work, or to leave work:
(a)

if they need to care for members of their Immediate Family or household who are
sick and require care and support, or who require care due to an unexpected
emergency, or the birth of a child; or

(b)

upon the death in Australia of an Immediate Family or household member.

The Casual staff member and their Supervisor will agree on the period for which they will be
entitled to be unavailable to attend work. If agreement cannot be reached, the Casual staff
member will be entitled to be unavailable to attend work for up to 48 hours (i.e. two days) per
occasion. No payment will be made for any period of non-attendance.

COMPASSIONATE LEAVE
266.

Staff (other than Casual staff) are entitled to paid compassionate leave in accordance with the
Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) in the event of the death or serious illness of a member of their
Immediate Family or household (or, as approved on a case by case basis by the University,
any other individual, including Indigenous kinship group members). Up to five days’ leave will
be granted on each occasion that leave is required.

FAMILY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEAVE
267.

Staff (other than Casual staff) are entitled to up to twenty days paid leave, and casual staff are
entitled to ten days paid leave, each year if as a result of Family and Domestic Violence they
require leave for reasons such as medical or counselling appointments, organising alternative
accommodation, care and/or education arrangements, attending court hearings, police
appointments and accessing legal advice. Leave does not accrue from year to year, and
unused leave is not paid out on termination of employment.

268.

The University will maintain a policy to provide guidance to staff about the support available to
them and to assist managers to provide a supportive workplace for staff who are experiencing
Family and Domestic Violence.

269.

Staff affected by Family and Domestic Violence may also apply for flexible working
arrangements under clause 206 (such as changes to working hours or to part-time
employment) and other supporting measures (such as changes to work location where
possible and changes to email address and work telephone number) as provided for in
University policy.
Note: Family and Domestic Violence is defined in clause 3.

NOTIFICATION AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR PERSONAL, COMPASSIONATE, FAMILY AND
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND GENDER AFFIRMATION LEAVE

A staff member who is unable to attend work must:
(a)

notify their Supervisor of their intended absence and its estimated duration as early
as practicable on the first day of their absence (or as soon as practicable thereafter
where due to exceptional circumstances notification cannot be provided on the first
day of the staff member’s absence); and

(b)

provide documentation that is acceptable to the University:
(i)

for any single period of absence of five working days or more; and

(ii)

if requested to do so for any absence after taking five separate periods
of sick, carer’s and/or Family and Domestic Violence leave in the

45

previous 12 month period without providing acceptable documentation,
provided that the staff member must have first been notified that they
have taken five such periods of leave and that a certificate or other
documentation is required for future absences. The requirement to
provide acceptable documentation will be for up to 6 months from
notification.
(c)

The requirements of clause 270(b)(ii) do not apply for staff accessing menstrual or
menopausal absences. Staff will only be required to provide suitable
documentation for single absences of five working days or more.

(d)

The requirements of clause 270(b)(ii) do not apply for staff accessing IVF and
other forms of assisted reproductive health services or Gender Affirmation and
Transition Leave. Staff who access this leave are only required to provide a
medical certificate or other suitable documentation upon first accessing the leave
and this certificate or documentation will be sufficient for all future occurrences of
less than 5 working days, provided that staff may be reasonably required to provide
further certificate or information if requested to do so.

(e)

Personal leave taken for any of:
(i)

Menstrual or Menopausal absences;

(ii)

IVF and other forms of assisted reproductive health services;

(iii)

Gender Affirmation and Transition, where Gender Affirmation and
Transition Leave has been exhausted,

is not included in any calculations under clause 270(b)(ii) to determine whether a
staff member has taken five periods of leave without providing acceptable
documentation in the last 12 months.
271.

Acceptable documentation for the purposes of clause 270(b) will include any one of the
following:
(a)

where it is not reasonably practicable for a staff member to obtain a medical
certificate; or

a letter from the staff member’s lawyer, doctor or other relevant agency in the case
of staff affected by Family and Domestic Violence.

GENDER AFFIRMATION LEAVE
272.

The University is committed to providing a supportive and inclusive environment for
transgender and gender diverse employees and recognises the importance of providing
support for employees who choose to undergo gender affirmation or transition. On
commencement of the Agreement, and for future staff on commencement of employment, all
staff (except casual staff) will be credited 30 days leave for purposes related to gender
affirmation or transition.
(a)

Purposes related to the affirmation of a staff member’s gender or gender transition

recovery from medical procedures); and

(iii)

legal affirmation (including legally changing the Employee’s name and/or

(c)

a further two months and 15 calendar days on full pay or five months leave on half

Full-time service* in excess of 15 years’ service.

*Note: For the purposes of long service leave, breaks in service of up to two months, or six
months in the case of Externally Funded Fixed Term employment, do not break continuity of
service, but the period of the break will not be counted as service: see clause 282.
274.

Part-time staff and staff with a combination of Full-time and Part-time service are entitled to
long service leave on a pro rata basis.

Leave entitlement – Casual staff
275.

Casual staff are entitled to long service leave in accordance with the Long Service Leave Act
1955 (NSW) in respect of service performed on or after 1 January 2010.

Taking long service leave
276.

Leave must be taken at mutually agreed times, and where agreement cannot be reached, the
matter will be referred to the Delegated Officer (Staffing) for resolution.

277.

Up to one month’s long service leave on full pay or two months’ leave on half pay may be
approved after completion of seven years’ Continuous Service provided that the staff member
enters into an agreement to provide for deduction of monies from their termination payments
and other repayment arrangements in the event that their employment ends before attaining
the necessary period of service to qualify for the leave that was taken.

Long service leave pay and payment in lieu of long service leave
278.

Long service leave pay and payments in lieu of long service leave will be calculated at the staff
member's Salary as defined in clause 3 in relation to paid leave and payments in lieu of leave.

279.

On termination of a staff member’s employment, payment will be made in lieu of long service
leave accrued under clause 273 or 275. Where at the time of termination a staff member has
five years’ Continuous Service with the University, but less than 10 years Continuous Service
and their employment is terminated by:
47

(a)

the University, for any reason other than serious and wilful misconduct; or

(b)

the staff member because of illness, incapacity or domestic necessity; or

(c)

the staff member's death;

the staff member will be entitled to payment in lieu of long service leave, but such payments
will be calculated at the rate of three months’ leave for 15 years' employment.
280.

If a staff member dies, the payment referred to in clause 279(c) will be paid to their estate
unless otherwise required by law.

Calculation of service and leave entitlements
281.

Periods of leave without pay do not count as service for the purpose of calculating long service
entitlements except:
(a)

unpaid leave taken to serve in the Australian Defence Force; or

(b)

unpaid leave of up to six months taken by staff with at least 10 years’ paid service.

282.

Breaks in service of up to two months, or six months in the case of Externally Funded Fixed
Term employment, do not break continuity of service for the purposes of long service leave,
but the period of the break will not be counted as service.

283.

Long service leave accrues on a pro rata basis during any period of paid leave taken at less
than full pay.

284.

Service with other Australian universities will be recognised in accordance with the University’s
Leave Policy 2021 in place at the commencement of this Agreement.

Arrangements specific to Fixed Term contracts
309.

Fixed Term staff are entitled to unpaid Parental Leave under clauses 291 and 292, and paid
Parental Leave under clauses 296, 300, 301 and 302 during the term of their contract.

310.

Except as provided in clause 311 entitlement to Parental Leave ceases when the Fixed Term
contract expires.

311.

If the Fixed Term contract is extended or renewed, or the staff member is subsequently offered
and accepts a further Fixed Term or ongoing contract of employment without a break in
service, the staff member will be entitled to take the Parental Leave that they would have been
entitled had their contract not expired.

312.

A pregnant staff member or a staff member who has given birth, whose Fixed Term contract
expires and who is not offered further employment, is entitled to a payment equivalent to up to
14 weeks’ Salary (as per clause 296) if they are either:

313.

(a)

at least 20 weeks pregnant at the time the contract expires; or

(b)

have commenced maternity leave under clause 296(a) or (b).

However, there will be no entitlement to the payment under clause 312 when their Fixed Term
contract expires if:
(a)

the staff member was offered and refused an offer of a further Fixed Term contract
of employment on terms and conditions substantially similar to, and on an overall
basis, no less favourable than, the terms and conditions of employment that applied
to the existing Fixed Term contract; or

(b)

it was made clear prior to the commencement of the Fixed Term contract that the
contract would not be extended or renewed and that the staff member’s
employment would end at the date or contingency specified in the contract.

314.

The University will pay any payment under clause 312 as a lump sum on the expiry of the staff
member’s Fixed Term contract.

315.

If the staff member is subsequently re-employed by the University having received payment
under clause 312, the University may offset any subsequent entitlement to Parental Leave
payment under this Agreement against the payment received, where it relates to the birth of
the same child.

52

Return to work after Parental Leave
316.

A staff member is entitled to return to the position that they held immediately before taking
Parental Leave, except that:
(a)

if a staff member was transferred to a safe job because of their pregnancy, the
relevant position is the position held immediately before the transfer;

(b)

if a staff member began working Part-time because of their pregnancy, the relevant
position is the position held immediately before the staff member began working
Part-time;

(c)

if a staff member immediately before starting Parental Leave, was acting in, or
temporarily performing the duties of, a position for a period equal to or less than the
period of leave, the relevant position is the position held by the staff member
immediately before taking the acting or temporary position; and/or

(d)

if the staff member occupied a position which no longer exists, they will be entitled
to return to an available position for which the staff member is qualified and suited
nearest in status and pay to their pre-Parental Leave position and, where possible,
located on the same campus as the redundant position.

(e)

Note: Where a staff member returns to work Part-time after a period of Parental
Leave any subsequent redundancy entitlements will be calculated in accordance
with clause 503(c).

317.

A staff member may apply to return to their pre-Parental Leave position, subject to clause 316,
on a part-time basis.

318.

Where it is not possible to return to their pre-Parental Leave position on a Part-time basis, the
University will offer the staff member another position on a part-time basis and in doing so will
make reasonable endeavours to transfer the staff member to a substantially similar and no
less favourable position.

319.

Any Part-time work arrangement that is agreed will be recorded as a variation to the staff
member’s contract of employment (or otherwise confirmed in writing) and will specify whether
and when the staff member will return to their substantive fraction of employment.

320.

Where a staff member has agreement under clause 319:
(a)

the variation may be up to a maximum of six years from the date of birth or
placement of the child, or when the child commences school, whichever is earlier;
and

(b)

the staff member may vary their return to their substantive fraction of employment
with 12 months’ notice.

321.

A staff member may apply to return to work from Parental Leave earlier than the leave dates
agreed if the pregnancy terminates without the birth of a living child or the staff member gives
birth to a living child but the child later dies.

322.

A staff member may apply to extend their period of approved Parental Leave no later than four
weeks before the end of their existing period of approved leave.

Impact of Parental Leave on service
323.

Paid Parental Leave counts as service for all purposes, but leave taken at less than full pay
will affect the accrual of annual and long service leave.

324.

Unpaid Parental Leave does not count as service for any purpose except that in the case of
staff with at least ten years’ paid service, up to six months unpaid Parental Leave will count as

53

service for the purposes of long service leave. Unpaid Parental Leave does not break
continuity of service.
Safe work during pregnancy and breastfeeding
325.

A staff member, including a casual staff member, who is pregnant or breastfeeding is entitled
to move to an appropriate safe job, if it is inadvisable for them to continue in their present
position during a stated period (the Risk Period) because of:
(a)

illness, or risks, arising out of her pregnancy; or

(b)

hazards connected with the position; or

(c)

substantial difficulties in performing the duties of their position while breastfeeding.

326.

The staff member is entitled to remain in their safe job for the Risk Period and to maintain the
same ordinary rate of pay, ordinary hours or work and other entitlements that they received in
their present position.

327.

Alternatively, if appropriate, a staff member and their Supervisor may:

328.

(a)

agree to different ordinary hours of work to those in their present position, in which
case their pay will be adjusted accordingly;

(b)

negotiate a working from home agreement for the Risk Period.

If requested to do so, a staff member will need to provide medical evidence that they are fit to
perform the duties of the safe job but that it is not safe to work in their present position.

Keeping in touch while on Parental Leave
329.

The University will inform staff who are on Parental Leave of any proposed changes which
may have a significant effect on the status, pay or location of their pre-Parental Leave position;
and will provide an opportunity for the staff member to discuss the effect on that position. This
will not preclude their participation in workplace change management processes as set out in
Part I: Managing Workplace Change.

330.

Where mutually agreed between a staff member and the University, a staff member may
participate in up to 10 paid whole or partial Keeping In Touch Days per 52 weeks during their
Parental Leave. Keeping In Touch Days are provided for work activities designed to help them
to stay in touch with their workplace and to facilitate their return to work after the end of the
Parental Leave.

331.

While on Parental Leave a staff member may also access professional development
opportunities; and may apply for, and be considered for, internal jobs or secondment
opportunities where they indicate that they are available to take up such opportunities.

RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEAVE
332.

Staff with at least 12 months’ Continuous Paid Service are entitled to research or professional
development leave as follows:
(a)

Continuing and Fixed Term Academic staff who have met their research objectives
in the previous 12 months, or in the case of education focused staff, have an
approved research plan, are entitled to up to three days’ leave each year to
undertake activities related to their current research or research proposals; and

(b)

Continuing and Fixed Term Professional staff who have been assessed as at least
meeting expectations or satisfactory (as applicable) are entitled to up to three days’
leave each year to undertake activities related to their professional development.

54

333.

In addition to leave under clause 332(b), Professional staff may also apply to take up to five
days of their accrued personal leave each year for career development purposes. Such leave
will be approved in accordance with University policy, and is in addition to, and will not
diminish any study leave or staff development entitlements that are otherwise available under
University policy.

Pro rata entitlements
334.

Staff who work Part-time and/or have taken more than three months’ unpaid leave during a
year will be entitled to research or professional development leave on a pro rata basis.

Applying for and taking research or professional development leave
335.

Staff must apply for leave under clause 332 or 333 by submitting a proposal to their
Supervisor setting out the activities to be undertaken and explaining how those activities would
benefit their research or professional career development. Such leave will be approved in
accordance with University policy.

336.

Any costs associated with activities undertaken while on research or professional development
leave (such as travel costs and course fees) are the responsibility of the staff member.

337.

Leave may be taken in one or more periods. Unused research or professional development
leave does not accrue from year to year, and is not paid out on termination of employment.

JURY SERVICE
338.

A staff member who is summoned as a prospective juror must notify their Supervisor as soon
as possible of the date/s when they are required to attend for jury service.

339.

Upon providing proof of attendance, a staff member who is required to undertake jury duty will
be granted:

340.

(a)

paid leave for the period necessary for such service, in which case the staff
member must forward to the University any fees (other than reimbursement of
expenses) received for such jury service; or

(b)

leave without pay for the period necessary for such service, in which case the staff
member will be entitled to retain any fees received for such jury service.

Where a staff member who takes paid leave fails to forward such fees to the University, the
period of their absence for jury service will be treated as leave without pay, and any salary
paid for the period of absence will be repayable to the University.

DEFENCE LEAVE
341.

Staff are entitled to four weeks’ paid leave per year to undertake Australian Defence Force
(ADF) Reserve service training and operational duty.

342.

An additional two weeks’ paid leave may be taken in a staff member’s first year of ADF
Reserve service for attendance at recruitment and initial engagement training.

343.

With the exception of the additional two weeks in the first year of service, leave can be
accumulated and taken over a period of two years.

344.

Defence Reserve leave counts as service for all purposes, with the exception that unpaid
leave in excess of six months does not count for the purposes of accruing annual leave.

EMERGENCY SERVICES LEAVE
345.

The University will grant up to ten days’ paid leave per year for the purposes of undertaking
voluntary emergency management activities and related training.

55

346.

Additional leave will be granted where such leave is reasonable having regard to all the

organisation (as defined in the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act
1989 (NSW) or a “recognised emergency management body” as defined in the Fair
Work Act 2009; and

(b)

provides documentary evidence of their membership, training requirements and
call-outs attended if requested to do so.

SPECIAL LEAVE
348.

The University may approve paid special leave in accordance with University policy. Other
than in exceptional circumstances, special leave may not exceed three days.

349.

Where a staff member has experienced significant effects as a result of a natural disaster, up
to five additional days of special leave will be available for the staff member to take necessary
immediate recovery action.

Special Leave for casuals policy entitlement (to assist with illness/injury)
350.

The University will introduce and maintain a policy that provides paid special leave on 5 days
per year for casuals to take during times when they are unable to attend work due to personal
illness or injury. The policy will be introduced within 12 months of the commencement of the
Agreement, following consultation in accordance with clause 14.

LEAVE WITHOUT PAY
351.

56

PART G: MANAGEMENT OF WORK AND PERFORMANCE
PERFORMANCE OF WORK
353.

Staff may be directed by the University to carry out such functions and duties as are consistent
with the nature of their appointment, classification/level and employment fraction, and are
within their skill, capability and training and are without risks to health and safety. Other
factors to be taken into account when assigning work will include:
(a)

the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance between work and family life;

(b)

provision of appropriate opportunities for career development;

(c)

the working hours specified in this Agreement; and

(d)

ensuring equity within each work unit.

WORKPLACE CONDUCT, DIVERSITY, ANTI-DISCRIMINATION, BULLYING AND HARASSMENT
General Principles
354.

Staff must comply with the Codes of Conduct (as defined in clause 3).

355.

The University is committed to employment practices that promote diversity and inclusion and
that seek to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, intersex status, age, physical or mental disability, marital or
relationship status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, trade union
membership and activity, national extraction or social origin.

356.

The University is committed to eliminating all forms of workplace harassment, unlawful
discrimination, bullying, and violence, including but not limited to sexual violence, gendered
violence and intimidation and staff and the Unions support the University taking all reasonable
and proportionate steps in support of that commitment. The University acknowledges the
intersection between personal violence and inequality due to sex, race, disability, sexual
orientation, gender identity and other characteristics protected by anti-discrimination
legislation.
Note: it is unlawful for an employer, staff member or other person to victimise or otherwise take
adverse action against a person because the person has reported or complained about
workplace harassment, unlawful discrimination, bullying, or violence or participates in a
process (including as a witness or complainant) in dealing with those matters.

357.

The University has developed and will maintain and deliver mandatory education and training
materials for staff and students that are designed to help prevent harassment, discrimination,
bullying, sexual misconduct (including sexual harassment) and other forms of violence at the
University. The materials will include information on how to make a complaint or report issues
directly or on behalf of others, The training materials will be updated periodically and taking
into account any input from the Unions. The University has and will maintain a comprehensive
suite of policies and processes to deal with any complaints or reports of bullying, harassment,
discrimination and sexual misconduct.

358.

The commitments in the above clauses are supported by the Bullying, Harassment and
Discrimination Prevention Policy, the Bullying, Harassment and Discrimination Resolution
Procedures, the Staff Sexual Misconduct Policy and the Staff Sexual Misconduct Response
Procedures, which provide a framework for managing any incidents of workplace bullying,
harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct in a fair and timely manner. These policies
will remain in force and will not be changed without consultation with the Unions through the
normal process and through the Joint Consultative Committee, including consultation over the
final form of the policy.

57

359.

The University will within the first 6 months after commencement of the Agreement and
periodically thereafter review those policies in consultation with the Unions, including to identify
further improvements in the complaints resolution processes and implement a risk mitigation
plan. In doing so the University will review and take into account guidance materials provided
by Safe Work Australia.

Unacceptable Behaviour
360.

Workplace harassment, bullying, discrimination and violence of any kind is unacceptable
behaviour and will not be tolerated.

361.

Staff must co-operate with the University and comply with all reasonable directions of the
University directed at preventing, responding to or minimising the risk of workplace bullying,
harassment, discrimination and violence.

362.

Examples of behaviours that may contribute to workplace bullying, harassment, discrimination
and/or violence include but are not limited to:
(a)

verbal abuse or threats, including yelling, insulting or offensive language;

(b)

unjustified criticism or complaints;

(c)

assigning impossible tasks, or meaningless tasks unrelated to the job, or giving
someone the majority of unpleasant tasks;

(d)

assigning too much or too little work;

(e)

setting unreasonable timelines or constantly changing deadlines;

(f)

deliberately excluding someone from work related activities, meetings and events;

(g)

unreasonably denying access to information, supervision, consultation or resources;

(h)

withholding information that is essential to perform a task properly;

(i)

spreading misinformation or rumours;

(j)

making threats or comments about job security without foundation;

(k)

changing work arrangements, such as rosters or leave, to deliberately
inconvenience a worker;

(l)

excessive scrutiny at work;

(m)

unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favours;

(n)

unwelcome touching, hugging or kissing;

(o)

sexually suggestive comments or jokes;

(p)

displaying, sending or requesting sexually explicit pictures;

(q)

recording or distributing an intimate image of another person;

(r)

violence or threats of violence;

(s)

stalking and intimidation; and

(t)

physical abuse.

58

363.

Staff who want to make a report or complaint of harassment, bullying, discrimination or sexual
misconduct should do so in accordance with the relevant policies and processes. When a staff
member does choose to make a report or complaint, the University will respond appropriately,
and ensure that the staff member is given internal and external support, as needed, including:
(a)

taking reasonable steps to secure the safety of the complainant, the respondent
and other impacted staff from the initiation of the complaints process (which may
include, where reasonable and possible and taking into account the nature of the
issues, the complainant not being required to interact with the respondent while the
matter is being determined); and

(b)

if it is determined that unacceptable behaviour has occurred, the University will take
reasonably practicable steps and actions to address the unacceptable behaviour.

364.

Where a staff member does not accept the outcomes of a preliminary assessment or the
actions taken under the relevant policy they may have the matter referred to the Delegated
Officer (Staffing) for a review.

365.

Nothing in this Agreement prevents a staff member from applying to the Fair Work
Commission, or from seeking other external advice or assistance at any time in dealing with
workplace bullying, harassment, discrimination or sexual misconduct.

INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM
366.

The Parties are committed to the protection and promotion of intellectual freedom, including
the rights of:
(a)

Academic staff to engage in the free and responsible pursuit of all aspects of
knowledge and culture through independent research, and to the dissemination of
the outcomes of research in discussion, in teaching, as publications and creative
works and in public debate; and

(b)

Academic, Professional and English Language Teaching staff to:
(i)

participate in the representative institutions of governance within the
University in accordance with the statutes, rules and terms of reference
of the institutions;

(ii)

express opinions about the operation of the University and higher
education policy in general;

(iii)

participate in professional and representative bodies, including Unions,
and to engage in community service without fear of harassment,
intimidation or unfair treatment in their employment; and

(iv)

express unpopular or controversial views, provided that in doing so staff
must not engage in harassment, vilification or intimidation.

367.

The Parties will encourage and support transparency in the pursuit of intellectual freedom
within its governing and administrative bodies, including through the ability to make protected
disclosures in accordance with relevant legislation.

368.

The Parties will uphold the principle and practice of intellectual freedom in accordance with the
highest ethical, professional and legal standards.

WORKLOADS – ACADEMIC STAFF ONLY
Objective of academic workload provisions
369.

The objective of clauses 370 to 394 is to provide a framework for ensuring that academic
workloads are equitable, transparent, manageable and without risks to health and safety.
59

Workload allocation principles
370.

Academic workloads will be determined on a fair, transparent and consultative basis, having
regard to the following principles:
(a)

the allocation and recognition of academic workloads should support the strategic
directions of the University and, except for education focused, PhD Fellows,
Professional Practitioners and research only staff or where otherwise agreed in
accordance with clause 386, will encompass the elements of teaching, research
and service while taking into account the career aspirations of Academic staff;

(b)

the allocation of academic work should reflect the multiplicity of career trajectories
for Academic staff, and that the emphasis between different areas of academic
work for an individual member of staff may shift throughout their career;

(c)

an Academic staff member’s workload should be suitable to their stage of
development and level. For example, Level A and B staff in the first year of their
appointment should have a lower teaching load than experienced staff as they need
time for research. Level A staff will not normally have sole responsibility for the
design and delivery of courses. Unless otherwise agreed, Level D and E staff are
required to provide evidence of research mentoring and support for early career
staff; and

(d)

for teaching and research staff (i.e. staff other than “research only”, PhD Fellows,
Professional Practitioners and “education focused” staff), academic work will be
assigned to ensure a well-balanced portfolio encompassing, unless an alternative
allocation is agreed in accordance with clause 386, on average:
(i)

teaching and teaching-related activities – 40%;

(ii)

research and scholarship– 40%;

(iii)

professional & community engagement and administration – 20%.

Workload allocation policy
371.

Each academic work unit must have in place a workload allocation policy that complies with
the provisions of this Agreement. For the purposes of this clause, academic work units will be
determined at the Faculty level in consultation with Academic staff, and may comprise the
Faculty, individual Schools or other organisational units.

372.

Workload allocation policies will be developed in a way which identifies a transparent
correlation between the measure applied and hours of work generated.

373.

Workload allocation policies will ensure that all aspects of academic work as appropriate and
relevant for inclusion in a workload allocation policy for the particular work unit are addressed,
and work allocated to casuals will take into account the principle in clause 60.

374.

Workload allocation policies in each Faculty or University School are developed (or reviewed)
by a collegiate committee involving members of the academic staff. The Collegiate Committee
should have representative membership covering academic levels, genders and relevant
schools within a Faculty including a representative of casual academic staff and education
focussed staff.

375.

Existing Workload policies continue to apply unless and until replaced. A workload allocation
policy will be reviewed by the Faculty collegiate committee up to each two years if requested
by a majority of academic staff in the Faculty to whom the model applies or if requested by the
Dean (and in any event at least every 4 years). The collegiate committee will make
recommendations to the Dean for consideration. Recommendations of the collegiate
committee should be by consensus wherever possible, but if consensus cannot be reached
can be made by 75% approval of the committee.
60

376.

If there are any substantive changes or a new workload allocation policy they will then be put
to a specially convened meeting of academic staff (open to all academic staff covered by the
policy) in the academic work unit for endorsement (including casual representation).
Reasonable notification will be provided for the meeting.

377.

If recommendations of the collegiate committee cannot be agreed or are not adopted and the
matter cannot be resolved internally in the Faculty within a reasonable time, then a mechanism
to address those protracted workload issues will apply. The issues can be referred to the
University's Workload Monitoring Committee (WMC) for advice by the WMC to the Dean. If
the matter then remains unresolved the issue may be referred to the Provost for consideration
taking into account the requirements of the clause and any recommendations by WMC, to
determine the issue. If any decision of the Provost is made to change a faculty workload
policy, that proposed outcome will be adopted if endorsed by a specially convened meeting of
academic staff (open to all academic staff covered by the policy). If it is not endorsed the
existing workload policy will continue to apply.

378.

Copies of each workload allocation policy will be provided to the Workload Monitoring
Committee and posted on the University’s intranet.

379.

Within 12 months of commencement of this Agreement, the University will develop normative
expected workload allocations reflecting reasonable allocations for teaching and research staff
and for education focussed staff to assist in allocating workloads. These normative expected
workload allocations will be developed by heads of discipline for consideration and
endorsement by the relevant collegiate committee and will supplement the existing workload
policy, where endorsed by a specially convened meeting of academic staff in the relevant
academic unit.

Individual workload allocation
380.

Each Academic staff member’s workload will be allocated in consultation with the staff member
concerned, having regard to:
(a)

the staff member’s level of appointment and time fraction;

(b)

the needs of early career staff to establish their research profile;

(c)

the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance between work and family life;

(d)

the working hours specified in this Agreement; and

(e)

the annual and other leave plans of the staff member. No staff member will be
required to make up time, take on additional duties or alter the duties that would
normally be undertaken as a result of taking leave. For example, no staff member
will be required to perform additional teaching duties as a result of taking leave
during a teaching period.

381.

A staff member who is enrolled for a research higher degree will be allocated a proportion of
time to undertake such studies, provided that their research higher degree Supervisor certifies
that adequate progress has been made.

382.

In determining the allocation of academic workloads and their quantification, the following
factors will be taken into account:
(a)

modes of delivery, including, for example, face-to-face teaching, on-line learning
and blended learning;

(b)

the level of courses taught;

(c)

preparation for teaching, curriculum development and the development of course
materials;

61

383.

(d)

supervision and mentoring of staff and students, including required attendance at
classes or meetings;

(e)

research, scholarship, creative production;

(f)

the number of students taught;

(g)

staff development requirements;

(h)

field work supervision;

(i)

internal and external professional work;

(j)

administration, including participation on committees;

(k)

overseas teaching and international commitments;

(l)

intercampus travel;

(m)

University service and community engagement; and

(n)

carers’ responsibilities and/or disabilities.

In determining reasonable hours the University will have regard to the following:
(a)

the total number of hours required be worked each day on a particular day;

(b)

the number of teaching and/or required hours worked without a break;

(c)

the time off between finishing and starting times of teaching sessions;

(d)

the number of days of the week during which teaching and/or required duties are
scheduled;

(e)

the provisions of the Work Health & Safety Act 2011 and health and safety issues
generally;

(f)

the incidence of evening work;

(g)

the incidence of overseas work;

(h)

the staff member’s general workload; and

(i)

the staff member’s caring needs/responsibilities.

384.

The required duties will be such that they can reasonably be expected to be completed in a
professional and competent manner within an average of 37.5 hours per week, and staff will
not be required to work more than 1,695 hours per year.

385.

The workload allocation will factor in the hours required as a consequence of the class size for
tutorials, seminars and laboratory groups; and will take into account such factors as the nature
of the activity, safety requirements, and availability of teaching facilities.

386.

The total amount of teaching and related activities for teaching and research staff will not
exceed 40% of the total workload over a 12 month period, unless otherwise agreed by the
staff member and their Supervisor. Staff members may agree to a different workload
allocation to 40:40:20 and are encouraged to do so where there is a reasonable basis.

387.

Staff will not be required to commence teaching within ten hours of the conclusion of a
teaching session, or other directed duties, conducted on the previous day.

62

388.

Staff will not be required to teach on weekends or public holidays without their agreement.
Where teaching is agreed to on weekends or public holidays, the staff member will take time
off in lieu at a time agreed by the staff member and their Supervisor.

389.

Staff will not be required to:

390.

(a)

teach more than two semesters per year without their agreement (including agreed
arrangements in relation to compensation for additional teaching beyond a two
semester load); and/or

(b)

teach overseas without their agreement.

Any change in the teaching year or academic calendar will be subject to consultation with
affected staff and, if requested, their Representative(s).

Part-time Academic Staff
391.

Clauses 370 to 390 will apply to Part-time staff on the basis of the work being in proportion to
their fraction of employment, including the following:
(a)

during the normal weekly hours of employment, in addition to face-to-face teaching
or other equivalent delivery of teaching, Part-time Academic staff are required to
provide associated duties in the nature of preparation, marking and student
consultation; and

(b)

in addition to teaching and associated duties, Part-time Academic staff may be
required to participate in the academic and administrative activities of the school
and be available on campus for some or all of the nominal hours of employment.

Workload Monitoring Committee
392.

The University will maintain a WMC for the purposes of overseeing and supporting the
implementation and monitoring of clauses 370 to 390. The membership of the WMC will be
five nominees of the University, including the Provost, a Dean, a Head of School and a Senior
Faculty Administrative Manager, and five nominees of the NTEU one of whom must be a
Casual staff member.

393.

The role of the WMC is to:

394.

(a)

monitor the operation of each workload allocation policy and review each policy on
an annual basis to ensure that the provisions of this clause are observed;

(b)

ensure each workload allocation policy provides a reasonable basis for determining
comparison of workload quantum across the University; and

(c)

in relation to education focused roles – monitor workload allocations, oversee
workload protections and manage workload concerns.

The WMC will meet at least twice each year or as the Committee otherwise agrees, or as
required, including by referral under clause 374.

Workload Review Panel
395.

A staff member who is concerned that their workload allocation is unreasonable or excessive
or that the workload allocation process has not been fairly applied should in the first instance
seek to resolve their concern with their Supervisor.

396.

Where discussions with a staff member's Supervisor do not resolve their concern, they may
request a review by the Head of School who will consider the concerns and ensure that the
workload is not unreasonable or excessive and the allocation process has not been unfairly
applied and may confirm or adjust the workload allocation.

63

397.

If the matter is not resolved under clause 396 and the staff member remains dissatisfied, the
staff member or their Representative may request that a Faculty Workload Review Panel be
convened. The Workload Review Panel will comprise a Chair, nominated by the Provost, who
is a senior academic independent of the School, a Faculty nominee, and an NTEU nominee.
The Chair will be nominated by Provost from a list of nominees that the University and NTEU
agree to via the JCC within 12 weeks of commencement of the Agreement, or may otherwise
be agreed between the University and the NTEU at the time.

398.

The Workload Review Panel will convene as soon as reasonably possible, will consider the
matters raised and information provided (and may request further information). The Panel will
consider the concerns and will determine whether the workload allocation is unreasonable or
the allocation process has not been fairly applied and determine any appropriate adjustments.

Other dispute resolution
399.

In respect of matters not addressed by a Workload Review Panel, where a dispute arises
regarding the operation of clauses 370 to 390, the issue will be resolved through the Review
of Action procedures of this Agreement.

WORKLOADS FOR PROFESSIONAL STAFF
400.

401.

The University recognises that having a culture that encourages work life balances is an
important contributor to the health, wellbeing and safety of staff. Supervisors and staff will
work together to ensure that work is allocated in a way that is equitable, transparent,
reasonable and consistent with the University’s obligations, including work health and safety,
having regard to:
(a)

maintaining a balance between work and personal life, including carers’
responsibilities;

(b)

reasonable adjustment for disabilities;

(c)

provision of opportunities for career development, including access to professional
development leave;

(d)

the working hours specified in this Agreement;

(e)

the staff member’s classification level, skills and training, employment fraction and
the nature of their appointment;

(f)

equity within each work unit;

(g)

current vacancies within the unit; changes to structure and/or introduction of
changed or new services; and

(h)

annual and other personal leave plans of the staff member.

Where it is proposed a staff member will be required to perform significant extra duties for any
reason, including but not limited to:
(a)

the introduction of significant new tasks, duties or functions;

(b)

another staff member's leave;

(c)

a position becoming vacant; or

(d)

a position being made redundant,

management will ensure that staff are not required to perform excessive work, and create a
record (eg a note or email) to be shared with the staff member of the approach or measures to
help prevent excessive work being required to be performed.
64

402.

Supervisors will review workloads at regular discussions with staff to ensure that they are
reasonable. The review of workloads will also form part of the annual P&D process and any
outcomes noted within the PP&D form primary indicators of an unreasonable workload may
include:
(a)

ongoing need to work excessive hours;

(b)

unreasonable and unwanted overtime; or

(c)

inability for staff to clear accrued leave or credited flexitime; or

(d)

feedback from staff that workload has intensified and is not able to be reasonably
completed within ordinary hours or by reasonable overtime.

403.

Should a staff member or staff members have concerns about their workload, the concerns
should be raised with their Supervisor. If a staff member has practical suggestions as to how
to alleviate the concerns they are encouraged to provide these. The Supervisor will consider
the concerns raised and suggestion offered and take reasonable steps to resolve the matter,
including, where appropriate, making adjustments to workloads.

404.

In their examination of concerns raised, the Supervisor should consider if relevant:
(a)

actual hours worked;

(b)

changes in staffing levels over time, including employee turnover and unfilled
vacancies;

(c)

changes in volume of work recently or over time;

(d)

changes to the nature and requirements of work;

(e)

reported staff experiences or concerns; and

(f)

any other factor.

405.

Where a staff member notifies their supervisor under clause 403 that they have concerns
about their workload, and that they are unable to complete their directed work or required work
within their normal working hours, and is directed to complete the work outside of ordinary
hours the staff member will be paid at the overtime rates provided for in Schedule 4 of this
Agreement. If overtime is requested and not expressly authorised, it is accepted that staff will
not be required to do any work that cannot be completed within their normal working
hours(including within any flexi time the staff member chooses to undertake). For the
avoidance of doubt, in those circumstances, the supervisor may direct certain work to be
prioritised during normal working hours, pending any resolution under clauses 406 and 407.

406.

Following a notification in clause 403 and review of such the Supervisor will advise the staff
member in writing of the outcome of their meeting including what steps are being taken to
resolve the concerns being raised.

407.

If the matter remains unresolved the staff member may refer the matter to their Supervisor’s
supervisor within the work unit for resolution. If the matter remains unresolved after this step
the staff member may request a review by a Workload Review Panel, comprised of a nominee
of the Delegated Officer (Staffing) (Chair), who is independent of the work area, a member
nominated by management and a nominated staff representative (ie either nominated by the
staff member or their union representative). The Chair will be nominated by the Delegated
Officer (Staffing) from a list of nominees that the parties agree to via the JCC within 12 weeks
of commencement of the Agreement.

408.

The Workload Review Panel will undertake the review and make any recommendations to the
appropriate delegate who will consider said recommendations. If the recommendations are

65

not accepted by the delegate, the staff member may refer the matter to the Delegated Officer
(Staffing) under clause 542 of the Dispute Settling procedures in the Agreement.
409.

The Joint Consultative Committee will monitor overtime and leave balances and may be used
as a forum to facilitate consultation on workloads, and will be provided with a report on the
number of panel reviews convened including outcomes under this clause.

66

PART H: PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
PAY AND CAREER EQUITY
Disability and Lived Experience
410.

The parties recognise the importance of ensuring that the University implements its evidencebased disability employment plan as part of the Disability Inclusion Action Plan (DIAP). This
will ensure that the University is a welcoming place for people living with disability. The parties
also acknowledge that recognising the lived experience of workers living with a disability brings
value to the University and improves the lives of people with disability.

411.

The priority for implementation over the life of this Agreement will be to ensure that the DIAP is
informed by data that provides insights into the work experience of staff living with a disability.
Such data will include (but not be limited to):
(a)

number of staff who declare they are living with disability;

(b)

retention rate;

(c)

training opportunities and participation;

(d)

number of workplace adjustments made to assist people living with disability in
performing their work; and

(e)

information from the staff engagement survey around difficulties encountered and
career development.

412.

The University will encourage staff with disability to provide information and data to help inform
the DIAP.

413.

The University will report annually to the JCC on progress with the DIAP.

414.

Prior to the nominal expiry of the Agreement, the University will, in consultation with the Unions
and staff living with disability, undertake an evaluation of the DIAP. The evaluation will inform
the next Disability Inclusion Action Plan. It will include (but not be limited to) assessment of
the following:
(a)

that the University is a safe and welcoming place for staff living with disability;

(b)

that career development opportunities recognise and allow for the impacts of
disabilities; and

(c)

dependent on appropriate approval/exemption being provided create identified
disability (lived-experience) career development positions from approved vacancies.

Pay Equity
415.

The University is committed to striving for pay equity across genders. The University will:
(a)

report annually to all staff on the average pay levels for each gender of staff at each
classification level and outcomes of applications for classification reassessment on
a de-identified basis; and

(b)

in consultation with the Joint Consultative Committee, continue to develop and
implement appropriate strategies to remedy any identified problems in relation to
pay equity across genders.

67

Career Equity
416.

The University’s selection, probation and promotion procedures will value the skills and
experiences of all genders, including women and members of other Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) groups. The University will:
(a)

continue to implement and monitor procedures to ensure that all individuals
involved in selection, probation and promotion are aware of and apply such values;

(b)

continue to implement strategies designed to overcome career path obstacles for all
staff but with particular emphasis on redressing points of disadvantage experienced
by women and members of other EEO groups;

(c)

continue to implement mechanisms for achieving gender balance in University
governance and all University committees within the life of this Agreement;

(d)

within the life of this Agreement, periodically report to staff on existing and proposed
strategies designed to equalise career opportunities for all staff, but with special
reference to women and members of other EEO groups; and

(e)

consult with the Unions through the Joint Consultative Committee about improving
gender equality within the University and advancing the above objectives.

P&D PROGRAM
417.

The University is committed to providing a working environment that fosters excellence in
teaching, world-class research and best practice organisational professionalism and
performance. A key element to achieving these objectives is the University's P&D Program.

418.

The University will consult with staff through the Joint Consultative Committee in relation to the
operation of the P&D Program.

419.

All staff are required to participate in the P&D Program in accordance with the University’s
policies and procedures, and will have access to a range of staff development opportunities.
Supervisors, Advisors and staff will undertake training in relation to the P&D Program.

420.

The P&D Program should be used to jointly identify any particular staff development needs
that may assist or improve the staff member’s career development or their ability to carry out
the duties of the position successfully and supervisors should encourage such discussion.

421.

Final sign off of a staff member’s P&D will be carried out by a University staff member, other
than in the medical faculties where an affiliate may have such responsibility.

422.

As part of the initial stages of a P&D review for a Professional staff member, the Supervisor
and staff member will review the position description to ensure currency, and update it if
necessary. Where the duties of the position have changed significantly, staff and Supervisors
should refer to clauses 158 to 161 of the Enterprise Agreement.

423.

The P&D review will be based on the agreed objectives and goals that have been set in
relation to the Professional staff member’s position description, and recognise that business as
usual activities form part of the work/performance to be reviewed. All reviews undertaken will
be relative to opportunity.

424.

Staff will be provided with adequate time to participate in and complete the P&D review.

425.

Casual staff who are engaged on a regular and systematic basis for 12 months will have the
opportunity to have their performance assessed in accordance with the P&D Program, and
other Casual staff may also have their performance assessed in accordance with the P&D
Program. It is recognised that unless Casual Professional staff have their performance
assessed in accordance with the P&D Program, they will not be eligible to apply for conversion

68

under clause 82 unless there is evidence that the casual staff member sought a P&D
evaluation and this was not actioned by the supervisor.
Professional Staff
426.

For staff at HEO6 and below, the P&D process will also include discussion of opportunities
available through the Professional Staff Development Fund under clauses 440 to 450.

427.

A Professional Staff member whose performance is assessed as outstanding or having far
exceeded expectations (as applicable) may be granted a performance progression payment in
the form of an accelerated salary increment (including into the next classification level) for a 12
month period as set out in clause 181. The decision to grant a performance progression
payment will be reviewed annually through the staff member’s P&D Program evaluation.

All Staff
428.

Staff members working part time will have expectations of performance, projects and
deliverable measured on a pro-rata basis.

429.

Staff living with a disability will have accommodations made and concessions incorporated into
their P&D expectations and review.

430.

An employee may raise a grievance on matters pertaining to procedural fairness of a
performance assessment via clause 542 or via the Dispute Resolution process.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL STAFF
431.

The University is committed to supporting the development of Professional staff to achieve
their personal career goals as well as the University’s strategic objectives.

432.

Staff will be assisted in their ongoing development through the P&D Program, including
through the implementation of agreed development plans, which may include actions such as
participation in training and development programs, further study, secondment and exchange
schemes, job rotations and temporary transfers or placements, either within the University or
externally.

Professional Staff Secondment and Exchange Scheme
433.

Subject to clause 434, where a Professional staff position is to be filled on a temporary basis
for a period of three to 12 months, expressions of interest will be invited through advertisement
on the University website for at least three days. Continuing, Fixed Term and Casual
Professional staff employed at the time of advertisement will be eligible to submit expressions
of interest in advertised vacancies. Selection decisions will be made on the basis of:
(a)

relevant skills and experience;

(b)

“Next Step” career development goals as specified in the applicant’s current
Performance Planning and Development Evaluation;

(c)

relevant operational factors affecting the capacity of the staff member’s work area to
release them to fill the temporary vacancy; and

(d)

whether the staff member has had other recent temporary transfers or development
opportunities.

434.

The Delegated Officer (Staffing) may approve waiving the advertising requirements in
clause 433 in exceptional circumstances.

435.

The University will maintain a Professional Staff Secondment and Exchange Scheme and the
online system to enable staff to register their interest in participating in the Scheme and/or be
notified of temporary vacancies. Staff with at least 12 months’ Continuous Service are eligible

69

to register their interest in temporary vacancies in the online secondment register, and receive
email notifications of vacancies at particular HEO levels, locations and/or areas of work.
436.

Staff in different work areas at the same HEO level or within one HEO level of each other may
apply for a short term position exchange. Applications will be considered on the basis of the
criteria in clause 433.

437.

Staff participating in a position exchange will continue to be paid at their usual Salary, and will
not receive any higher duties allowance or other loading in respect of their placement.

438.

Staff who have been employed for more than four years in the same position and at the same
HEO level will be given preference in consideration to participate in the Secondment and
Exchange Scheme.

439.

The University will report annually to the Joint Staff Consultative Committee on the number of
staff participating in the Scheme and the distribution of participation by HEO level, gender and
occupational group.

Professional Staff Development Fund
440.

The University will allocate at least $2.2 million each year to fund programs and activities to
assist Professional staff to develop the skills and expertise required to achieve their career
development goals (the Professional Staff Development Fund).

441.

The Professional Staff Development Fund is to be used for development programs and
activities such as courses of study, training programs, scholarships, conference attendance
and external secondments and the associated costs of staff replacement, for those attending
the development opportunity.

442.

Access to the fund will be at the initiation/request of staff members, and will not be at the
direction of management. Courses which management request staff to undertake will be
funded through the University or Work Unit’s general training budget.

443.

While it is not necessary to record proposed applications to the PSDF in the annual PP&D
process there is nothing preventing staff and their supervisor discussing and agreeing to
development activities available under the fund within the PP&D Process.

444.

The University will maintain an online portal which shall be the first step staff members seeking
to access the Fund. At a minimum the portal will record the following details on applications:
(a)

work unit of applicant;

(b)

HEO Level of applicant;

(c)

gender of applicant;

(d)

details of program or activity requested; and

(e)

the cost where approved, and where not approved, the reason for the decision.

445.

The University will ensure that there is a staff member with responsibility for advising staff on
making applications to the fund, and to record, monitor and report on use of the fund. This
position will be funded from the $2.2 million allocation.

446.

The details of the applications will be reported in writing to each meeting of the Joint
Consultative Committee.

447.

Where a staff member makes an unsuccessful application for an activity to be funded under
this clause:
(a)

they can appeal the decision through clause 542 Review of Decision; and

70

(b)

they remain eligible to apply for leave under clause 332 or 333 of this Agreement to
undertake the activity.

448.

The University will endeavour to distribute funds evenly (i.e. 50% each) across occupational
groups, across genders and between those employed at HEO Levels 1 to 6 and 7 and above.
Where it becomes apparent that the distribution of the funds is unlikely to meet these
requirements, the University will raise the matter at the JCC. Implementation of any agreed
outcomes through the JCC will be deemed to have met these criteria.

449.

The Professional Staff Development Fund will not be used for:

450.

(a)

Specific position-related training provided to a staff member to meet the immediate
or imminent requirements of their current position; or

(b)

Any development or advancement activities for which the University has no
demand.

Unused funds will not carry over from the end of 2023 to 2024, however in subsequent years
unused funds will carry over unless otherwise agreed by the Joint Consultative Committee. In
considering whether the funds should carry over, the committee will consider if the University
has demonstrated that it has deployed all reasonable efforts to spend the monies and that it
has not unreasonably refused any applications. This is to encourage staff to apply for and
make use of the development fund.

Advertising Professional Staff Vacancies
451.

452.

Advertising Professional staff vacancies:
(a)

Priority assessment will be given to staff who are on the redeployment list before
other candidates are considered for a vacancy.

(b)

Eligibility lists will be used to support greater internal mobility. Where the same or
substantially similar role has been advertised in the previous 12 months and an
internal staff member on an eligibility list has been deemed appointable, they will be
considered prior to advertising the role. An eligibility list is a list of candidates for an
advertised role, who have previously been assessed by a selection committee as
being eligible for appointment if the same or substantially similar role becomes
vacant within 12 months.

(c)

Management will report to each meeting of the JCC, positions that have been filled
through the eligibility list and positions where a relevant eligibility list could have
been but was not used. The JCC will review the functioning over the life of the
Agreement to provide recommendations on the best practise and ways to ensure
that staff are not systematically deprived of opportunities through the use of the list.

If internal eligibility lists are exhausted, roles greater than 3 months will be advertised internally
and may be advertised externally, as follows:
(a)

subject to this clause, all Professional staff vacancies of more than 12 months’
duration at HEO 1 - 7 will be advertised internally in the first instance;

(b)

all Professional staff vacancies of more than 12 months' duration at HEO8 and
above will be advertised. Advertising for these roles may occur internally and
externally simultaneously, however, hiring managers are encouraged to advertise
internally in the first instance;

(c)

an identical position at HEO 1 -7 that has been previously advertised internally
without success in the past six months may also be advertised simultaneously
internally and externally; and

71

(d)

where a role is advertised internally in the first instance, internal advertisement will
remain open for at least six business days, after which the relevant Delegate may
authorise external advertising after reviewing applications received by the internal
closing date. The University encourages selection committees to interview
potentially suitable internal applicants, or a shortlist of such applicants, before
deciding whether to advertise externally.

453.

Vacancies at or below HEO 5 will not be advertised externally if there are suitable internal
applicants who are assessed as satisfying the relevant selection criteria through the normal
selection process.

454.

Unsuccessful internal applicants will be given feedback about their application if requested.
An unsuccessful internal applicant may request the Delegated Officer (Staffing) to conduct or
arrange an audit of the selection process if they consider on reasonable grounds that there
has been a breach of the Recruitment and Selection Policy. The Delegated Officer (Staffing)
may make recommendations in relation to future selection processes, such as training for
selection committee members or changes to the Recruitment and Selection Policy.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING
Individual Metrics
455.

The University will not use unit wide service level results as the basis for performance
management on an individual basis. Except with otherwise agreed, any issues of
unsatisfactory performance will be assessed on a staff member's individual performance.

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
456.

Where a staff member has been assessed as not meeting expected standards or
unsatisfactory (as applicable) or otherwise fails to perform their duties to a satisfactory
standard, their Supervisor will:
(a)

notify them in writing of any deficiencies in their performance and the improvements
necessary to meet the required standard. At this time the supervisor will inform the
staff member that they have the right to be represented by their union or a support
person;

(b)

provide an opportunity to discuss and consider the concerns that have been
identified, including but not limited to the staff member’s views around mitigating
factors such as excessive workload, ill health, the absence of training, resources or
guidance which the staff member might reasonably expect to have received;

(c)

provide guidance, and where appropriate, counselling, professional development or
training to assist the staff member to improve their performance to the required
standard;

(d)

specify a timeframe within which the necessary improvements are required,
ensuring that the time frame provides sufficient time that the improvements can be
achieved and demonstrated; and

(e)

where a staff member does not agree with the assessment that their performance is
not meeting expected standards or is unsatisfactory, they can raise their concerns
in accordance with clause 541.

UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE
457.

Where a staff member’s performance has not improved to the required standard after being
notified under clause 456 of their Supervisor’s concerns, a performance improvement plan will
be established in consultation with the staff member. The performance improvement plan
must specify:

72

(a)

the required performance standards (which must be reasonable having regard to
the level and duties of the position);

(b)

the action required to remedy the deficiencies in the staff member’s performance,
including any additional counselling, professional development or training that may
be required; and

(c)

the time frame within which the necessary improvements are required.

458.

The performance improvement plan must be provided to the staff member concerned who will
be given an opportunity to sign the plan to acknowledge receipt and provide comment on it. A
staff member whose performance is not meeting the required standard and who, as a result, is
at risk of having their employment terminated will be given written notification to this effect.
The written notification will advise the staff member in general terms of the relevant provisions
of this Agreement.

459.

Where, in the opinion of the Supervisor, the staff member’s performance does not improve to
the required standard within the time frame specified in their performance improvement plan
(or such further time frame as may be approved by their Supervisor), the Supervisor will
provide a written report to the relevant Delegate setting out what constitutes the unsatisfactory
performance and outlining the steps which have been taken under clauses 456 and 457. The
report will also be given to the staff member who will have ten days to respond, in writing, to
the relevant Delegate.

460.

The relevant Delegate will make a determination as to an appropriate course of action taking
into account any response provided by the staff member under clause 459.

461.

Where the relevant Delegate determines that the appropriate course of action is the
withholding of an incremental increase, salary reduction or termination of employment, the
staff member will be given an opportunity to seek a review of the proposed decision in
accordance with clause 546 before a final decision is made. A request for a review must be
made within five working days of receipt of notice of the proposed Disciplinary Action.

MISCONDUCT AND SERIOUS MISCONDUCT
462.

Where a staff member’s Supervisor or a relevant Delegate becomes aware of allegations that
the staff member may have engaged in Misconduct or Serious Misconduct:
(a)

The Supervisor or relevant Delegate may undertake or arrange such preliminary
investigations or enquiries as they consider necessary to determine an appropriate
course of action to deal with the matter.

(b)

The Supervisor or relevant Delegate may, in the case of a less serious matters,
seek to resolve the matter directly with the staff member concerned through
guidance, counselling, warning, mediation or another form of dispute resolution.

(c)

In cases other than those which are dealt with under clause 462(b), the staff
member will be provided with allegations in sufficient detail to ensure that they have
a reasonable opportunity to respond. The staff member will be given ten days to
respond to the allegations.

(d)

If the staff member admits the allegations in full, the relevant Delegate may take
Disciplinary Action.

(e)

In other cases the relevant Delegate may:
(i)

proceed to deal with the matter under clause 462(f); or

(ii)

if the Delegate considers it appropriate to do so, appoint an Investigator
to investigate the allegations and report to the relevant Delegate on their
findings of fact and any other matters requested by the relevant
73

Delegate. The Investigator will determine the procedure to be followed
in conducting the investigation, subject to the requirement that such
procedure must allow the staff member concerned with a reasonable
opportunity to respond to the allegations against them, including any new
matters, or variations to the initial allegations resulting from the
investigation process. The Investigator will provide a written report to the
relevant Delegate and a copy to the staff member.
(f)

Where the relevant Delegate is satisfied that a staff member has engaged in
Misconduct or Serious Misconduct, the relevant Delegate may take Disciplinary
Action against the staff member, provided that:
(i)

before taking Disciplinary Action the relevant Delegate must be satisfied
the staff member has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond to
the allegations against them;

(ii)

in any case of Disciplinary Action other than counselling, a direction to
participate in mediation or an alternative form of dispute resolution or a
written warning, the staff member must be given notice of the proposed
Disciplinary Action and an opportunity to have the allegations examined
by a Review Committee in accordance with clause 546. A request for a
review must be made within five working days of receipt of notice of the
proposed Disciplinary Action; and

(iii)

a staff member’s employment may be terminated only if they have
engaged in Serious Misconduct, as defined in clause 3 of this
Agreement.

(g)

Any time after the staff member’s Supervisor or a relevant Delegate becomes
aware of allegations that the staff member may have been engaged in Misconduct
or Serious Misconduct, the relevant Delegate may suspend the staff member with
or without pay.

(h)

A staff member may be suspended without pay only if:

(i)

(i)

the relevant Delegate considers that there is a possibility of a serious
and imminent risk to another person or to the University's property or
that the allegations are sufficiently serious that it is considered possible
that the staff member may be dismissed if the allegations are proven; or

(ii)

the staff member has been notified that the relevant Delegate proposes
to recommend the termination of the staff member’s employment and the
staff member has requested a review of that decision.

Where a staff member is suspended without pay, the following will apply:
(i)

if the suspension occurs at a time when the staff member is on paid
leave, he or she will continue to receive Salary for the period of paid
leave;

(ii)

the staff member may engage in paid employment or draw on any
annual leave or long service leave credits during the suspension without
pay;

(iii)

the relevant Delegate may at any time direct that Salary be paid on the
ground of hardship;

(iv)

the staff member may request a review of the decision to suspend them
without pay under clause 546. Such review will be conducted within five
days of receipt of the request from the staff member, and a

74

determination will be made within ten days of receipt of the request. The
suspension without pay will continue during the review period; and
(v)

(j)

any lost salary and other entitlements will be reimbursed if the decision
to suspend without pay is overturned or it is determined by the relevant
Delegate that the alleged misconduct is not substantiated. If it is
determined that the alleged misconduct is partly substantiated, the
relevant Delegate may exercise a discretion to reimburse all or part of
the lost Salary and entitlements.

A staff member who is excluded from the University will be permitted reasonable
access to the University for the preparation of their case and to collect personal
property.

75

PART I: MANAGING WORKPLACE CHANGE
PRINCIPLES
463.

Where the University proposes to introduce changes in programs, organisation, structure or
technology that are likely to have a significant effect on staff, the University will consult those
staff who are directly affected by the proposed changes in accordance with clauses 463 to
475. For the purposes of clauses 463 to 475 “significant effects” include:
(a)

termination of employment;

(b)

change to the composition, operation or size of the University’s workforce or to the
skills required of staff;

(c)

elimination or diminution of job opportunities (including opportunities for promotion
or continuing employment);

(d)

outsourcing of work;

(e)

reallocation of a significant proportion of the duties and responsibilities of staff;

(f)

restructuring and/or relocation of work units; and

(g)

alteration of hours of work that involve changes of the kind specified in (a) to (f).

464.

The consultation process set out in clauses 468 to 475 will provide directly affected staff and
their unions with a genuine and timely opportunity to exchange relevant information, participate
in discussions, and provide feedback on change proposals and implementation arrangements,
and to have their views taken into account before final decisions are made. The consultation
process will be collegial, but consultation does not necessarily mean that agreement will be
reached. If proposals put forward by staff or their unions cannot be agreed to, reasons will be
given. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to provide reasons does not apply to
suggestions provided by staff at the Preliminary Stage in clause 467.

465.

The University will ensure that adequate time for consultation and for staff to give feedback is
provided in each step of the process and if required staff will be given reasonable time away
from their work activities to enable them to participate in the consultation process.

466.

At any stage in the consultation process, staff may involve a Representative of their choice,
including a Union representative.

PRELIMINARY STAGE
467.

In the interest of collegiality, where the University identifies problems or issues with the
operation or structure of the University that it considers are likely to lead to a formal change
proposal, staff and the unions will usually be consulted prior to the procedures outlined in the
remainder of this clause. This process will involve the University providing staff and the unions
with details of the issues that have led to the need for the consideration of the change, and the
issues it considers need to be addressed. The University will provide any information that is
readily available (not including commercial-in-confidence and other confidential information) to
demonstrate the problem or issues to be addressed. Potentially affected staff and the unions
will be given the opportunity to provide suggestions as to what form the change should take, or
whether change is needed. The University will consider any responses prior to proceeding
with a formal change proposal under this clause.

CONSULTATION STAGE 1
468.

Where the University develops a firm proposal to introduce change of the kind referred to in
clause 463 affecting more than one staff member, the University will prepare a Draft Change
Proposal for consideration by and consultation with directly affected staff and their unions.
The Draft Change Proposal will outline what the proposed change is, what the purpose of the
76

proposed change is and the expected outcomes of the proposed change, and will include,
where relevant:
(a)

financial information, if financial imperatives form part of the reasons for the
proposed change;

(b)

anticipated financial implications of the proposed change;

(c)

organisational charts outlining the current structure and proposed structure, and
where possible, draft position descriptions;

(d)

copies of any reports, or parts of reports, whether internal or external that have
directly lead to the proposed change, unless such reports are commercial in
confidence or legally privileged;

(e)

expected outcomes including expected advantages and disadvantages;

(f)

proposals to mitigate negative effects including training, re-training and
redeployment;

(g)

ways to minimise any disadvantages to work health and safety in the workplace;

(h)

the anticipated timing of the consultation and timing of the proposed implementation
of change;

(i)

the expected effects the change process will have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander employment, and (where applicable) what steps are being proposed for
this plan to assist the University to meet its employment targets;

(j)

implications for staff including changes in duties, number of staff, workload and/or
work environment; and

(k)

proposals to address any anticipated changes to workloads, potentially including
cessation or reduction of work; demonstrable efficiencies in processes, information
technology, or similar; and/or the redistribution of any remaining work.

469.

Upon release of the Draft Change Proposal, the University will include the Draft Change
Proposal in the Organisational Change Management report which is circulated to the Joint
Consultative Committee and appears on the University Intranet.

470.

Staff will be invited to respond to the DCP, and where staff request meetings will be held (if
this has not already occurred) allowing staff to seeking clarification from management of
issues, and to raise and discuss concerns.

471.

Where the proposed change involves likely need for mapping of staff, if it has not already done
so, the University will facilitate reviews of current position descriptions under clauses 155 to
157 of the Agreement to ensure they are up to date prior to the implementation of the change.

CONSULTATION STAGE 2
472.

The University will give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised by staff and their
unions and will prepare a Revised Change Proposal, which will include:
(a)

a summary of any amendments to the Draft Change Proposal (and access to a
track change version of the original DCP);

(b)

if relevant to the change being proposed, or if altered from the Draft Change
Proposal, an updated organisational chart;

(c)

if relevant to the change being proposed, or if altered from the Draft Change
Proposal, position descriptions and classification levels;
77

473.

(d)

all feedback on the Draft Change Proposal, with the exception of feedback that
contains sensitive, confidential or personal information;

(e)

the University's response to feedback received including reasons;

(f)

if relevant, indicative mapping of positions to the new structure; and

(g)

a draft implementation plan.

The draft implementation plan will include:
(a)

the way in which the proposed change is implemented;

(b)

the anticipated timing of implementation; and

(c)

a mechanism for evaluating the change with affected staff to allow affected staff to
have input into the evaluation of the proposed change, including whether the review
should be by a person independent of and external to the area of the change.

474.

The University will consult with directly affected staff and their unions on the Revised Change
Proposal and genuinely consider their views before making a final decision in relation to the
proposed change and its implementation.

475.

Where the feedback on the Revised Change Proposal results in significant changes, the
University will issue a further Revised Change Proposal allowing staff to provide further
comments on the Revised Change Proposal.

Implementation
476.

A Final Change Plan will then be issued setting out the University’s decision and
implementation plan and confirm the goals and expected outcomes of the change. The Final
Change Plan will also include a summary of the matters raised by staff and/or the unions and
the University’s response to those matters.

Review
477.

The University, in consultation with directly affected staff, will conduct a review of the change
implemented as a result of the Final Change Plan, against its goals, expected outcomes within
6-12 months of the Final Change Plan’s release and to identify opportunities to improve future
change processes. The review will also consider what impact the change had on Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander employment, where this can be reasonably identified.

478.

Where the review identifies that ongoing work remaining from a disestablished position(s) has
not been successfully accommodated within the available workloads of remaining ongoing and
fixed term Employees, the University will address the issues.

479.

The review may be conducted by a person independent from and external to area and
management team responsible for change plan, where this is reasonable based upon the
significant nature and extent of the particular change. The review will invite staff directly
affected by the change process, as well as other stakeholders who interact with the area to
provide feedback.

CHANGES AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL STAFF
480.

For each proposed change of the kind referred to in clause 463 affecting only one staff
member, the University will consult the staff member concerned (and where requested, their
Union or other Representative) and provide them with an opportunity to provide feedback on
the proposed change and implementation arrangements before any final decision is made.
The processes in clauses 463 to 476 are not required to be applied provided that the change
will not result in unreasonable workload implications for other staff in the work area. Matters

78

affecting an individual staff member which are not resolved may be dealt with under
clauses 542 to 544 or clauses 555 to 558.
CHANGES TO ROSTERS OR HOURS OF WORK
481.

Where the University proposes to change a staff member's regular roster or ordinary hours of
work, the University will consult with the staff member or staff members affected and their
representatives, if any, about the proposed change, in accordance with clause 482. The
processes in clauses 463 to 476 are not required to be applied.

482.

The consultation process will include:
(a)

the provision of information about the proposed change;

(b)

the ability for staff members and their representatives to give their views about the
impact of the proposed change (including any impact in relation to income, flexitime, Flexible Working Arrangements and/or their family or caring responsibilities);
and

(c)

consideration by the University of any views about the impact of the proposed
change that are given by the staff member or staff members concerned and/or their
representatives.

483.

Clauses 481 to 482 should be read in conjunction with other provisions in this Agreement
concerning the scheduling of work and notice requirements.

484.

Where the changes referred to in clauses 481 to 482 have significant effects on staff, the
University will regard clause 463 as applicable.

79

PART J: REDEPLOYMENT AND REDUNDANCY
EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF STAFF
485.

Clauses 486 to 503 do not apply to:
(a)

staff employed on a casual basis;

(b)

staff serving a period of probationary employment;

(c)

staff employed for a Fixed Term, in relation to the termination of their employment
at the end of the specified term, task or project;

(d)

staff employed for a Fixed Term under a contract that provides for contingency in
circumstances where the contingency is invoked or occurred;

(e)

postgraduate fellows in relation to the termination of their employment at the end of
the fellowship;

(f)

Academic Fellows employed on a Fixed Term basis in relation to the termination of
their employment at the end of the Fixed Term;

(g)

External Funded staff employed on a Funding Contingent Continuing basis.

JOB SECURITY
486.

The University has a goal of maintaining the overall size of its workforce. However, where
reductions in staff occur, the University will endeavour to redeploy affected staff as far as
practicable, and will utilise involuntary redundancies only as a last resort. If the University
decides to reduce staff, it will first consider measures such as:
(a)

inviting expressions of interest in voluntary redundancy, including if appropriate,
from staff in a cognate area;

(b)

reducing numbers by natural attrition;

(c)

offering part-time employment;

(d)

offering voluntary early retirement schemes; and/or

(e)

arranging suitable alternative employment.

VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT SCHEMES
487.

The University may offer early retirement in accordance with voluntary early retirement
schemes approved by the Australian Taxation Office, but reserves the right to reject an
expression of interest in voluntary early retirement submitted by an individual staff member.

REDEPLOYMENT AND REDUNDANCY
Notice of redundancy
488.

Where the University has determined that a staff member’s position is redundant, they will be
notified in writing and offered voluntary redundancy. A notice period of 12 weeks will
commence on the date the written notification is dispatched by Express Post or email to the
staff member (the Notice Period). The written notification will provide an estimate of the staff
member’s entitlements to notice (or payment in lieu of notice), severance pay and payments in
lieu of accrued leave.

80

489.

Staff will be entitled to up to one day’s paid leave per week (pro rata) during their Notice Period
and Extended Notice Period for the purposes of seeking other work, outplacement service or
financial advice.

490.

The Notice Period will be extended by any period of paid Parental Leave which falls within the
12 week period.

Consideration period
491.

492.

During the notice period the staff member may choose whether to:
(a)

Seek a review of the decision to make their role redundant;

(b)

Accept the offer of voluntary redundancy;

(c)

Seek redeployment elsewhere within the University, in which case the University
will seek to redeploy them to a another position.

Where a staff member does not make an election within the first 4 weeks of the notice period
they will be deemed to have elected redeployment.
Where the staff member elects to seek a review of the decision to make their position
redundant the review will be conducted under the processes outline in this Agreement at
clauses 546 to 554. If the proposal to make a staff member’s position redundant is confirmed
following a review, the staff member will be given a further 4 weeks to elect to take a voluntary
redundancy or to continue with the redeployment process.

Accepting an offer of voluntary redundancy
493.

Where a staff member accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy, their employment will end on
the date specified in the written notification or such other date as the University and the staff
member may agree. If the end date is earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the staff
member will be paid in lieu of the balance of the Notice Period.

494.

On cessation of employment, the staff member will receive payment in lieu of the balance of
the Notice Period under clause 488 (if applicable) and severance pay under clause 502.

495.

A staff member who agrees to an alternative employment end date later than the expiration of
the Notice Period to suit the needs of the University will receive an additional payment
equivalent to four weeks’ Salary. A staff member’s entitlement to this payment will be
confirmed by the University in writing at the time of confirming the employment end date.

Redeployment
496.

The University will endeavour to redeploy staff whose positions have been made redundant
and have not accepted an offer of voluntary redundancy. A staff member must not
unreasonably refuse redeployment to a position at their existing level (including a position at
another location) or to undertake training.

497.

Where a staff member who is seeking redeployment is potentially suitable for a vacant
position, they will be considered in advance of other candidates. A staff member may be
redeployed on a trial basis for up to six months during which time the staff member’s new
Supervisor will assess their performance in accordance with the P&D Program.

498.

Where a staff member is required to transfer to a new work location, they will be entitled to
relocation assistance in accordance with University policy.

499.

A staff member who is redeployed to a position with a lower Salary rate will continue to be paid
at the Salary they received immediately prior to redeployment for a period of six months or
until the salary applicable to their new role matches their previous salary, whichever occurs

81

first. Loadings and/or allowances will continue to be paid only if they are loadings and/or
allowances which also apply to the position to which the staff member has been transferred.
Extended notice period
500.

This clause will only apply to:
(a)

staff members:
(i)

employed in positions classified at HEO levels 1 - 7 (with exceptions for
highly specialised roles);

(ii)

whose positions are declared redundant;

(iii)

who do not accept an offer of voluntary redundancy; and

(iv)

who are not successfully able to be redeployed through the processes
set out at clauses 496 to 499 of the Agreement.

(b)

Staff to whom clause 500(a) applies will be offered an extended notice period of
nine months (inclusive of the 12 week Notice Period in clause 488, and the duration
of any unsuccessful redeployment on a six month trial basis under clause 497) (the
"extended notice period").

(c)

During this extended notice period, the University will continue to seek to redeploy
the staff member into a suitable alternative position, and the staff member will enter
a redeployment pool and undertake any work available at the reasonable direction
of the University.

(d)

Staff members participating in this extended notice period who are temporarily
placed into a position that is classified below the classification of their substantive
position will continue to be paid the Salary applicable to the staff member
immediately prior to being placed into such a position for the balance of the
extended notice period.

(e)

A staff member who, during this extended notice period, refuses a suitable
alternative position that has been made available to them or to undertake any work
that is reasonably directed, will forthwith be given notice of cessation of employment
under clause 501 of the Agreement and will be paid the severance payments
specified in clause 502. The provisions relating to Consideration Period, voluntary
redundancy, redeployment, Notice Period, extended notice period and review of
decisions in clause 546 will not then have any application or operation in respect of
the staff member.

(f)

For a staff member who has not been successfully redeployed within the extended
notice period, at the expiry of the extended notice period they will be given notice
(or paid in lieu of notice) and severance in accordance with clauses 501 and 502 of
the Agreement. The provisions relating to Consideration Period, voluntary
redundancy, redeployment, Notice Period, extended notice period and review of
decisions in clause 546 will not then have any application or operation in respect of
the staff member.

(g)

The commitment given in this clause will apply until 1 June 2026 (provided that a
staff member who has commenced the written notice in clause 488 prior to 1 June
2026 will be able to complete the process under this clause).

Involuntary redundancy
501.

Subject to the operation of clause 500, where a staff member has not accepted an offer of
voluntary redundancy and is unable to be redeployed, either at the conclusion of the Notice
Period, or if a period of redeployment undertaken by the staff member is not successful, their
82

employment will cease on grounds of involuntary redundancy. The staff member will be given
at least 5 weeks’ notice of the cessation of their employment if they are not redeployed, during
their Notice Period as referred to in clause 488 and Extended Notice Period as referred to in
clause 500, but not during the Consideration Period under clause 491.

PART K: MANAGING ILL HEALTH AND INJURY
Independent Medical Examination
504.

505.

After consultation with Human Resources, the relevant Delegate may require a staff member
to undergo an examination by an independent medical practitioner (who will be nominated by
the University) where the University has reasonable basis to believe that:
(a)

the staff member’s ability to perform their duties may be adversely affected by
illness or injury; and/or

(b)

the safety or welfare of the staff member and/or other staff or students may be at
risk of being adversely affected by the staff member’s illness or injury; or

(c)

the staff member has taken more than 20 days sick leave in the preceding
12 months and elements of clause 504(a) or 504(b) are present.

Where a staff member is required to undergo an independent medical examination under
clause 504:
(a)

the University will advise the staff member in person (where reasonably possible)
and in writing of the decision to send the staff member for an independent medical
examination and the reason for doing so under clause 504;

(b)

the staff member will be reminded of their right to have a support person present for
the meeting described at clause 505(a);

(c)

the University will provide the staff member with a copy of the referral document
sent to the medical practitioner when it is provided to the practitioner and at least
seven days’ notice of the date of the medical examination. Nothing in the clause
precludes the medical practitioner from requesting further information or liaising with
the staff member's regular practitioner;

(d)

the medical practitioner will be required to provide a report to the University, and the
University will provide a copy of the report to the staff member or their treating
medical practitioner; and

(e)

all reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the medical examination will be paid
for by the University.

Medical Termination
506.

The University may terminate a staff member’s employment on grounds of ill health if they are
unfit for duty where:
(a)

(b)

a medical practitioner’s report indicates that the staff member:
(i)

has a permanent medical condition which prevents them from performing
their normal duties; or

(ii)

will be unable to perform the inherent requirements of their role (with
reasonable adjustments) within 12 months (or in the case of a Fixed
Term staff member, within 12 months or the balance of the term of their
contract, whichever is the lesser); or

the staff member has been absent from duty due to illness or injury for 12 months
(either continuously or for periods totalling 12 months over the previous two years)
and has exhausted their paid personal leave and been absent for a further three
months after doing so.

86

507.

Where the University proposes to terminate a staff member’s employment for a reason
specified in clause 506 the staff member must be given written notification of the proposed
termination. The staff member will be given 14 days to respond to the notification.

508.

A staff member may:
(a)

elect to resign before the University terminates their employment provided that their
resignation takes effect within one month of receiving the notification under
clause 507; or

(b)

initiate their own medical retirement or seek a temporary disability pension under
their superannuation scheme. In these circumstances, the University will, on
receipt of evidence that an application for medical retirement or temporary disability
pension has been made, refrain from taking any action that would preclude the staff
member from medical retirement or disability pension benefits.

509.

After considering the staff member’s response (if any) the University will determine whether to
terminate the staff member’s employment. If the University proposes to terminate the staff
member’s employment, they will be given an opportunity to seek a review of the decision
under clause 551(e) before any final decision is made. Where a staff member requests a
review, the termination process will be deferred until the review is completed.

510.

A staff member whose employment is terminated on grounds of ill health will receive a
payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the table below:
Type/Length of Employment

Payment in lieu of notice

Continuing or Fixed Term staff member with
more than 12 month’s continuous service

employment, whichever is less

The above notice is inclusive of any notice required under clause 517.
511.

Where a staff member who is required to undergo a medical examination pursuant to
clause 504 fails to do so without reasonable cause, the University may terminate the staff
member’s employment by giving notice and providing separation pay in accordance with
clause 510. The failure to undergo a medical examination pursuant to clause 504 will not be
treated as Misconduct, and the staff member will not be subjected to any greater penalty or
loss of entitlements than would result from an adverse medical report.

512.

Nothing in this Part K: Managing Ill Health and Injury limits the rights of a staff member to
apply to their superannuation fund for a permanent disablement or temporary incapacity
benefit at any time and receipt of benefits or payments from their superannuation fund will not
impact upon their entitlements or payments under this Part K: Managing Ill Health and
Injury.

513.

Nothing in this Part K: Managing Ill Health and Injury precludes the University from taking
any action it considers necessary to meet its obligations under applicable health and safety
legislation.

514.

The University will ensure that the staff member is aware that they can have a support person
present at any meeting referred to above.

(b)

flexible working hours;

(c)

change processes, including reviews and evaluation of changes;

(d)

updates on policy and procedures; and

(e)

local workplace issues as raised by the NTEU, CPSU NSW or the University.

Any dispute in respect of the Local Joint Consultative Committees provisions in clauses 536 to
538 may be referred to the relevant Dean, Head of School and Dean or Head of Administrative
or equivalent budget unit, or their Supervisor if appropriate.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
540.

The Parties agree that the long term sustainability of conditions for University employment and
staff job security depends on the restriction of carbon emissions, reductions in energy and
water consumption and the development of environmentally sustainable work practices within
the University. To facilitate discussion and the development of initiatives to promote
environmental sustainability:
(a)

staff and their Unions will be kept regularly informed about the University’s carbon
emissions, water and energy consumption levels, and any other environmental
sustainability initiatives, through the Joint Consultative Committee;

(b)

the Joint Consultative Committee will be informed in a timely manner about any
proposal or change in work practices or the built work environment intended to
92

restrict carbon emissions, or reduce energy or water consumption. Such changes
should not disadvantage staff in their employment or increase health and safety
risks for staff; and
(c)

Staff Representatives on the Joint Consultative Committee will appoint two Union
members who will sit on the Emissions Reduction Working Group.

REVIEW OF ACTIONS AND DECISIONS AND DISPUTE SETTLING PROCEDURE
Local resolution
541.

Where concerns arise over actions (or failure to act) relating to decisions affecting the
employment of a staff member covered by the Agreement, the staff member concerned, and
where they choose, a representative of their Union, should discuss the matter with the staff
member’s Supervisor. Where the matter concerns the conduct of a staff member’s Supervisor
and it would be inappropriate to attempt to resolve the matter through discussions with the
Supervisor, the staff member may instead seek to discuss the matter with their Supervisor’s
Supervisor.

Review by Delegated Officer (Staffing)
542.

Where attempts to resolve the matter at the local level under clause 541 have not been
successful, the staff member may request a review of the decision or action by applying to the
Delegated Officer (Staffing). The Delegated Officer (Staffing) will take one or more of the
following actions:
(a)

appoint an Investigator to enquire into the matter and report to the Delegated
Officer (Staffing) on such matters as the Delegated Officer (Staffing) may direct;

(b)

review the matter and make recommendations to the relevant Supervisor in relation
to the matter;

(c)

appoint a Review Committee to examine the matter and report to the Delegated
Officer (Staffing);

(d)

appoint a mediator to assist the parties to the dispute to resolve the matter; or

(e)

decline to take any further action in relation to the matter.

543.

The Delegated Officer (Staffing) will inform affected parties of the action to be taken within ten
working days of referral of the matter, and such action will be completed within a further 20
working days or such other period as the Delegated Officer (Staffing) considers necessary
having regard to the nature of the matter.

544.

The right to request a review under clause 542 does not apply to any action or decision
relating to:
(a)

academic promotion;

(b)

applications to participate in the Special Studies Program for Academic staff; or

(c)

any other matter in relation to which an alternative review or appeal procedure is
provided in this Agreement or any University policy.

Review Committees
545.

Within four weeks of the commencement of this Agreement, the parties will establish a list of
nominees to form an external panel of Chairs for Review Committees. The list of nominees
will be submitted to the Joint Consultative Committee for approval, and in the event that any
nominee is not approved, the party whose nominee was not approved will submit alternate
nominees for approval. For the purposes of this clause, “approval” of the panel means
93

agreement by 75% of the members of the Joint Consultative Committee. Chairs must be
external to the University and have relevant experience, be independent and command the
confidence of management and staff. The Vice-Chancellor will be responsible for selecting a
Chair from the external panel, having regard to the requirements of this clause and the matter
to be reviewed. If it is necessary to convene a Review Committee at any time before an
approved external panel is established, or if no suitable external panel member is available to
chair a particular Review Committee, the Vice-Chancellor will appoint a Chair to ensure that a
Review Committee is convened in a timely manner in accordance with this Agreement.
546.

A staff member may request a review of a proposed decision under clause 462(g)
(suspension without pay), clause 462(f)(ii) (withholding of incremental progression or
reduction in pay) or to terminate their employment under clause 461 (unsatisfactory
performance), clause 462(f)(iii) (Misconduct or Serious Misconduct) or clause 507 (medical
grounds) or a proposal to make their position redundant under clause 488. A request for a
review of a proposed termination must be made within five working days of receipt of
notification of the proposed decision, and a request for a review of a proposed decision under
clause 488 (redundancy) must be made by the end of the consideration period specified in
clause 492.

547.

The University will convene a Review Committee within 10 working days of receipt of a
request.

548.

A Review Committee convened to review a proposed decision under clauses 461
(unsatisfactory performance), 462(f)(ii) or 462(f)(iii) (Misconduct or Serious Misconduct) or
488 (redundancy) will be comprised as follows:

549.

(a)

a Chair appointed by the Vice-Chancellor from a panel of external Chairs agreed by
the Joint Consultative Committee;

(b)

a management nominee appointed by the Vice-Chancellor; and

(c)

a staff nominee nominated by the designated Staff Representative of the Joint
Consultative Committee.

A Review Committee convened to review a proposed decision under clause 507 (medical
grounds) will be comprised as follows:
(a)

a Chair appointed by the Vice-Chancellor from a panel of medical practitioners
agreed by the Joint Consultative Committee;

(b)

one medical practitioner nominated by the Delegated Officer (Staffing); and

(c)

one medical practitioner nominated by the affected staff member or their
Representative.

550.

The role of each Review Committee is to make a recommendation to the relevant Delegate in
relation to the proposed course of action under review, having regard to the matters specified
in clause 551. If the Review Committee does not endorse the relevant Delegate’s proposed
course of action, the Review Committee’s report will be submitted to a more senior Delegate
for determination, except where the Delegate who first determined the matter was the ViceChancellor. The Delegate (or where applicable, the more Senior Delegate), must consider but
is not obliged to accept the Review Committee’s recommendation. Where the Review
Committee’s recommendation is not accepted, written reasons will be given.

551.

The matters to be considered by Review Committees are as follows:
(a)

In matters under clause 461 (unsatisfactory performance):
(i)

whether the procedures that were followed afforded the staff member the
procedural fairness provided for in clause 459, and if not, whether the

94

outcome was affected by any procedural defect that may have occurred;
and
(ii)
(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

552.

whether the proposed termination is reasonable in the circumstances.

In matters under clauses 462(f)(ii) and 462(f)(iii) (Misconduct or Serious
Misconduct):
(i)

whether any Misconduct or Serious Misconduct occurred, and any
factors in mitigation;

(ii)

whether the procedures that were followed afforded the staff member the
procedural fairness afforded by clauses 462(c) and 462(f), and if not,
whether the outcome was affected by any procedural defect that may
have occurred; and

(iii)

whether the proposed termination is reasonable in the circumstances.

In matters under clause 462(g) (suspension without pay):
(i)

whether the criteria in clause 462(h) have been satisfied; and

(ii)

the staff member’s personal circumstances and any hardship resulting
from the suspension.

In matters under clause 488 (redundancy):
(i)

whether the staff member's position was genuinely redundant;

(ii)

whether fair and objective criteria were used to select the staff member
for redundancy;

(iii)

whether the consultation requirements in clauses 468 to 476, or if
applicable, clause 480 were followed, and, if not, whether any
unfairness resulted from a failure to follow those requirements; and

(iv)

whether adequate consideration was given to measures to avert or
mitigate the adverse effects of redundancy, and if not, whether there
were alternative measures available.

In matters under clause 509 (termination on medical grounds), whether the staff
member is unfit for duty as defined in that clause.

Each Review Committee will determine its own procedures, but in doing so:
(a)

will provide the staff member (or their Representative) and the relevant Delegated
Officer’s representative with a reasonable opportunity to make submissions, present
and challenge evidence in relation to the matter before the Review Committee;

(b)

may conduct interviews with the staff member and other persons, and examine
documents as it thinks fit;

(c)

in respect of matters under clause 462(f)(iii) (termination for Serious Misconduct)
may treat evidence given to an Investigator, and the report of the Investigator
insofar as it constitutes direct report of the facts, as evidence;

(d)

will ensure that the staff member (or their Representative) and the relevant
Delegated Officer’s representative have a reasonable opportunity to see and/or
hear all evidence to be considered by the Review Committee and to ask questions
of any persons interviewed by the Review Committee; and

95

(e)

make its report available to the relevant Delegate within 10 working days of being
convened or such longer period as may be approved by the Delegated Officer
(Staffing).

553.

The staff member and the relevant Delegate may be represented before the Review
Committee by a person of their choice, provided that such Representative may not be a
currently practising legal practitioner in private practice.

554.

The University will provide a copy of the Review Committee’s report to the staff member or
their Representative.

DISPUTE SETTLING PROCEDURES
555.

556.

It is agreed that all staff and the University have an interest in the proper application of the
Agreement. The following procedures apply to any dispute about the application or operation
of this Agreement or the National Employment Standards:
(a)

in the first instance the affected staff member, and where they choose, their
Representative, should discuss the matter with the staff member’s Supervisor. A
Union may also initiate this procedure by raising a dispute with the University in
writing;

(b)

where the dispute is not resolved under clause 555(a) the affected staff member or
their Representative may request a discussion with a more senior level of
management. If no such request is made within five working days of the
discussions under clause 555(a) the matter will be deemed to have been resolved,
unless the parties agree to extend the time for discussions. Where a meeting is
requested, it will be convened within five working days of the request or at such
later time as the parties may agree;

(c)

if the dispute remains unresolved, either party may refer the matter to the Fair Work
Commission. If no party refers the matter to the Fair Work Commission within ten
working days of the discussions under clause 555(b), the matter will be deemed to
have been resolved, unless the parties agree to extend the time for discussions;
and

(d)

the Fair Work Commission may resolve the dispute by conciliation, and if
conciliation is not successful, by arbitration. The parties to the dispute agree to be
bound by and implement any order, decision or recommendation of the Fair Work
Commission, subject to any right of appeal under the Fair Work Act 2009.

Except where a genuine safety issue is involved, staff will continue to work in accordance with
their contracts of employment while the procedures outlined in clause 555 are being applied,
and during this time:
(a)

the University will not change anything which is the subject of the dispute;

(b)

the parties to a dispute must not take any industrial action or any action to make the
dispute worse.

However, nothing in this clause 556 prevents the termination of a staff member’s employment
during or at the end of a probation or confirmation period or on grounds of unsatisfactory
performance, Serious Misconduct, redundancy or ill health or the cessation of a Fixed Term
contract.
557.

Where a genuine safety issue is involved, staff will not be required to work in an unsafe
environment, but will undertake suitable alternative work until the issue is resolved.

558.

Any error in classification, category of employment, pay rate or entitlement under this
Agreement will be remedied as soon as possible after it is identified.

96

PART O: MISCELLANEOUS
UNION RESOURCES AND ACCESS
559.

560.

The University will provide each Union with:
(a)

office space on the Camperdown/Darlington campus;

(b)

access to a University notice board for posting authorised notices;

(c)

access to the University’s telephone system;

(d)

a University email account; and

(e)

arrangements through which their members may authorise the deduction of their
union membership dues from their salaries for on-forwarding to the Union.

The University will provide sufficient funding to each Union Branch President’s work unit to
cover 50% of the Branch President’s University salary to enable them to be released to
undertake Union work relating to the University and for the work unit to provide replacement
staff. Staff members who have been appointed by a Union to be a Union representative will be
given reasonable time off during working hours for the conduct of essential Union affairs.

UNION MEETINGS
561.

Each Union may, with the prior approval of the University, hold meetings of members on the
premises of the University at times and locations agreed between the relevant Union and the
University, subject to the requirement that in any case in which a meeting is to be held, the
Union will give the University adequate notice of their intention to hold the meeting and the
meeting must not be held during working hours (see Part 3-4 of the Fair Work Act 2009 Cth).

562.

Subject to the convenience of the University, staff members may vary their meal breaks to
allow them to attend a Union meeting, provided that they make up any time lost on the day of
the meeting, or by mutual agreement with their Supervisor, on another day.

563.

Each Union will be informed of all formal induction sessions for new staff and will be permitted
to distribute Union information at those sessions. The University’s HR Service Centre will
display information about Union membership and payroll deductions of Union dues, and supply
staff with relevant forms provided by each Union.

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TRAINING
564.

Leave of absence on full pay for up to six working days in any one calendar year may be
granted to a staff member who is a member of a Union for the purpose of attending courses or
seminars for the purposes of industrial relations training. Leave granted for these courses or
seminars will count as service for all purposes.

Review of allocation of hours

Casual academic staff may seek a review in accordance with the Work Classification And Payment
Guidelines For Casual Academic Staff, (which is summarised, below) where they consider they are
unable to complete work required by the University within the time allocated to the staff member in the
staff member’s schedule for required work activities or where there is non-allocation for required work.
The review process is as follows:


as soon as possible and prior to performing any additional work, the casual staff member
should request additional hours by approaching their Supervisor in the first instance;



the Supervisor will consider the work to be performed, the staff member's explanation and
whether the Supervisor requires the casual academic to perform any additional work or
whether an alternative arrangement can be made to avoid the need for additional work being
performed by the staff member;



where the Supervisor considers additional hours to be appropriate, the Supervisor will consult
with the Head of School / Deputy Head of School to request additional hours;



where the Head of School / Deputy Head of School decides that additional work is required to
be performed beyond the initial time or sessions allocated in accordance with this Schedule,
then the additional work and time should be added to the workload allocation spreadsheet and
108

a new allocation provided to the casual staff member in the Casual Academic Scheduling
System (CASS) (or any replacement system).
Outcomes of the review will be one or more of the following:


approval of additional time by the Head of School/Deputy Head of School as per the above
provisions to cover the extra time required to be worked; or



where additional time is not approved, an extra allocation does not apply, the casual academic
staff member would not be required to work in excess of the allocated time; and:


the staff member may be directed to perform the work differently or to a different
standard, to enable it to be completed in the allocated time;



alternative arrangements may be made for the completion of work by others or for
additional support to enable it to be completed in the allocated time; and/or



the additional work would not be performed.

SCHEDULE 4: WORKING HOURS AND RELATED MATTERS FOR PROFESSIONAL
STAFF
APPLICATION
1.

This Schedule applies to Professional staff employed in the classifications in Schedule 2 with
the exception that for staff employed in the University’s Centre for English Teaching,
Veterinary Clinics and Farms, the arrangements specified in Schedules 5, 6 and 7 prevail
over this Schedule to the extent of any inconsistency.

Day Work and Shift Work
2.

Staff to whom this Schedule applies will be employed as either day-workers or shift-workers.

3.

A day-worker (other than a student employed on a casual basis) is a staff member who works
their ordinary hours within the span 7.00am to 7.00pm Monday to Friday, excluding public
holidays. Students employed on a casual basis work their ordinary hours within the span
7.00am to 7.00pm, Monday to Saturday.

4.

By agreement between the University and a staff member who is a day-worker (other than a
student employed on a casual basis), the staff member may work within the span 7.00am to
7.00pm Monday to Saturday, excluding public holidays if they wish to do so, provided that their
weekly working hours are arranged to enable them to have at least two days off within the
calendar week.

5.

Students employed on a casual basis may work their ordinary hours within the span 7.00am to
10.00pm, Monday to Saturday if they request to do so.

6.

A shift-worker is a staff member who works according to a shift roster and whose span of
hours of work a week may extend beyond 7.00am to 7.00pm Monday to Friday.

Absence From Duty
7.

A staff member who does not attend for duty or reports for duty after their normal starting time,
and/or who ceases duty before their normal finishing time, and who does not provide a
satisfactory reason to the University for their absence, will lose salary equivalent to the
duration of the absence(s), calculated to the nearest quarter of an hour.

Meal Breaks and Related Matters
8.

Staff must not be required to work more than five hours without an unpaid meal break. Meal
breaks must be at least 30 minutes and no more than one hour, except with the approval of
the Supervisor. If a staff member is required to work any part of their meal break, the time
worked will be paid at the ordinary rate of pay.

9.

A shift-worker may take a paid crib break instead of a meal break with the approval of their
Supervisor.

10.

Staff who are required to work overtime must take unpaid meal breaks of at least 30 minutes in
accordance with clause 8 of this Schedule. Staff are entitled to a meal allowance as specified
in Schedule 3 where a meal break falls due and is taken during a period of overtime.

Flexitime Arrangements
11.

The University acknowledges that having a work/life balance is a key contributor to the health,
wellbeing and engagement of staff, and supports the University's commitment to gender
equity. The purpose of flexitime is to assist staff to attain work/life balance while at the same
time ensuring the University's operational requirements are met. All Professional staff may
apply to their Supervisor for participation in flexitime. While flexitime arrangements are not
automatic and are subject to agreement by a staff member's Supervisor, such agreement may

135

only be withheld based on demonstrable business grounds that flexitime does not meet the
requirements of the work area. Where a request is refused, written reasons will be given.
12.

Staff may work flexitime, subject to the following:

Availability of flexitime
(a)

flexitime will normally be approved for day-workers only. However, flexitime may be
approved by a Supervisor for shift-workers subject to the operational needs of the
work unit;

Core hours
(b)

unless on approved leave, including approved flexitime, staff must be in attendance
during the core hours set for their work area;

(c)

in normal circumstances, core hours will be no more than six hours per ordinary
day, unless there are demonstrable business reasons that would not make this
reasonably possible;

(d)

core hours will be established or varied in each work unit by management after
consultation with staff in the work unit;

(e)

core hours may vary for different employees within a work unit to suit operational
requirements;

Attendance and hours of work
(f)

all hours worked and absences must be recorded formally for accrual/audit
purposes;

(g)

staff may work flexitime hours outside their number and span of ordinary hours
specified in clauses 3, 4 or 6 of this Schedule if they are working to an approved
flexitime arrangement. Such hours will be paid at the staff member’s ordinary rate
of pay, and no shift, weekend or public holiday loadings will be paid for time worked
under such flexitime arrangements;

(h)

time may be accrued only by working additional time; no time is accrued during
leave or public holidays;

(i)

Supervisors may review hours worked outside core hours to ensure:

Accruals

(i)

the hours do not pose a risk to health and safety;

(ii)

appropriate work is being carried out;

(iii)

the hours meet the reasonable needs of the area;

(j)

flexitime hours accrued must be submitted by staff for review by Supervisors in fourweek cycles;

(k)

staff may accumulate a maximum of:
(i)

35 hour staff: up to 42 hours flexible time off; or

(ii)

38 hour staff: up to 46.5 hours flexible time off;

136

Flexible time off
(l)

as far as practicable, the pattern of hours worked to accrue time and take flexible
time off, will be agreed between each staff member and their Supervisor. Where
agreement cannot be reached, the hours worked will be determined by the
Supervisor provided that where a staff member has more than seven hours’
accrued time and has not taken a full day’s flexible time off at any time within the
relevant four week cycle, they must be permitted to take accrued flexible hours off
as a whole day within the next four week cycle;

(m)

staff and supervisors will periodically assess whether staff members are in excess
of the accumulation at sub-clause (c). If a staff member is in excess,
arrangements will be agreed so that flexible time off will be granted as soon as
reasonably possible and requests for flexible time off will not be unreasonably
refused;

(n)

with the approval of their Supervisor, staff are able to take accrued flexible hours off
in any quantum, including short periods, half days, as a whole day, or multiple days.
Supervisor approval for flexible time off will not be unreasonably withheld;

(o)

in normal circumstances staff wishing to take flexible time off during core hours for
their work area must obtain prior approval from their Supervisor, such approval will
not be unreasonably denied;

(p)

in exceptional or emergency circumstances staff may take flexible time off without
prior approval, in such situation they will inform their Supervisor and manager at the
first possible opportunity;

(q)

where organisational needs or workload prevent the taking of accrued flexible time
off in excess of the maximum accumulation at (c), staff will not lose any accrued
flexitime;

Termination, resignation and transfer
(r)

where a staff member gives notice of transfer, resignation, or retirement or whose
employment comes to an end due to redundancy, they must, with the approval of
their Supervisor, clear all accrued flexible hours prior to departure. If accrued
flexible hours cannot be cleared, a maximum of 42 hours for 35 hour staff, or 46.5
hours for 38 hour staff will be paid in lieu at their Ordinary Rate of Pay;

Local arrangements
(s)

approved local arrangements in place at the commencement of this Agreement will
be reviewed to ensure they comply with this clause. Where they comply they will
continue unchanged. Where they do not comply they will be updated within three
months of the introduction of this Agreement to ensure compliance;

(t)

if a Supervisor wishes to alter an approved local arrangement, the Supervisor will
discuss the matter with the affected staff with a view to reaching agreement. Where
agreement cannot be reached, the proposed arrangement will be referred for review
under clause 542 and, if required under clause 543 of this Agreement; and

(u)

any new local arrangements may be introduced after the commencement of this
Agreement provided:
(i)

they are created following a consultative process;

(ii)

they meet or are more favourable than the requirements of this clause.

137

Interaction with Overtime
13.

Flexitime and flexible time off are separate and distinct from working overtime and provisions
for time off in lieu of overtime, which are regulated by clauses 22 to 35 of this Schedule.
Flexitime is not intended to replace overtime. Management will not put any pressure on staff
to work additional hours as flexitime in lieu of overtime.

Shift Loadings
14.

Subject to clause 15 of this Schedule, the following shift loadings are paid to shift-workers in
addition to their ordinary rates of pay:
Shift

loading

15.

The loadings specified in clause 14 of this Schedule do not apply to students employed on a
casual basis who agree to work outside the span of 7.00am to 7.00pm, Monday to Saturday.
Where a student requests to work outside this span (for example, casual student shelvers in
the Library), the University may agree and ordinary casual rates will be paid for work
performed between the hours of 7.00pm to 10.00pm Monday to Saturday.

Work Rosters for Shift-Workers
16.

The University will post rosters showing the ordinary starting and finishing times for each
roster/shift that staff are required to work.

138

17.

Subject to clause 18 of this Schedule, at least 72 hours’ notice of shift changes and seven
days’ notice of roster changes days will be provided. Consultation will normally occur at the
local level in relation to proposed changes.

18.

A shift or roster may be changed at any time to enable the functions of the University to
continue, for example, where a shift-worker is absent because of illness or emergency.

19.

If a roster is altered under clause 18 of this Schedule, and a staff member is required to work
on a day which would have been their day off within the roster, the time worked by the staff
member on that day will be paid at overtime rates specified in clause 20 of this Schedule.

20.

If a public holiday falls on a staff member’s rostered day off, they will receive an extra day’s
leave or may take a day’s pay at the ordinary rate in lieu. The leave must be taken at a time
convenient to the staff member and the University.

21.

Places in rosters may be interchanged by agreement between staff members and their
Supervisor, provided that the University does not incur any additional shift or overtime
penalties as a result of the interchange.

Overtime
Requirement to work overtime
22.

The University may require a staff member to work reasonable overtime.

23.

Overtime is work that is performed at the direction of an authorised Supervisor:

24.

(a)

outside the staff member’s ordinary span of work hours; or

(b)

within that ordinary span of work hours, but outside the number of ordinary hours
the staff member would work on a day (or is formally rostered to work on that day);
or

(c)

scheduled on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.

If possible, staff will be given at least 48 hours’ notice of overtime to be worked. A staff
member who is not given 48 hours’ notice is not required to work overtime if they satisfy the
University that they have a good reason for not being able to work overtime that day.

Eligibility for overtime payment
25.

A staff member whose Salary does not exceed the maximum Salary for a Higher Education
Officer Level 9 is entitled to overtime pay or, where a staff member chooses, time off in lieu of
overtime pay. In special circumstances, the University may make overtime payments or
provide time off in lieu to staff whose Salary exceeds this amount.

Overtime payments and time off in lieu of payment
26.

27.

Overtime payments and time off in lieu will be calculated as follows:
(a)

Monday to Saturday: one and a half times the ordinary rate of pay (or hours
worked) for the first two hours and double time thereafter;

(b)

Sunday: double time; and

(c)

Public Holidays: two and a half times the ordinary rate of pay (or hours worked).

Payments and time in lieu will be calculated to the nearest quarter of hour and a minimum
payment of four hours (or three hours in the case of essential work on Sundays or public
holidays for feeding animals, watering etc) will be made for overtime worked on a day that is
not an ordinary working day for the staff member concerned.

139

28.

Time off in lieu of payment must be taken at mutually agreed times. A staff member may
accrue up to three weeks’ time in lieu within a six month period, and time not taken by the end
of the six month period will be paid out at overtime rates specified in clause 26 of this
Schedule.

29.

A staff member may request that time in lieu accrued but not taken be paid out as overtime at
the applicable overtime rates, Where a staff member makes such a request the University will
make payment in the next full pay period following the request.

30.

If on termination of a staff member’s employment, the employee has outstanding time in lieu it
will be paid in their final payment at overtime rates.

31.

A Casual Staff member who is required to work hours:
(a)

in excess of 20% of the ordinary weekly hours of an equivalent full-time staff
member on any one day (ie more than 7.00 hours or 7.6 hours for a 35 hour and 38
hour per week worker respectively);

(b)

outside the applicable span of ordinary hours,

will receive the greater of the overtime rates specified in clause 26 of this Schedule or the
casual loading specified in clause 72 of this Agreement, but not both.
32.

A staff member who works overtime must have at least ten consecutive hours off between
work on successive days, if reasonably practicable.

33.

If a staff member works overtime and does not have ten consecutive hours off before their
normal starting time on the next day, the staff member:

34.

35.

(a)

must be released at the end of the overtime until they have had ten consecutive
hours off, unless the Supervisor directs the staff member to continue working; and

(b)

must be paid for the time they would have normally worked in the ten consecutive
hours off work.

If a staff member resumes or continues work as directed by their Supervisor without having ten
consecutive hours off, the staff member:
(a)

must be paid at the overtime rate until they are released from work; and

(b)

is entitled to be absent for ten consecutive hours without loss of pay for work
occurring in that absence.

If a shift-worker works overtime for the purpose of changing shift rosters, or does not report for
work, and a day-worker replaces them, then clauses 33 and 34 of this Schedule apply as if
eight hours were substituted for ten hours.

On Call Arrangements
Requirement to be on call
36.

The University may roster staff to remain “on call” outside their ordinary working hours, i.e.
contactable and available to return to work within a reasonable time or deal with matters by
telephone or computer, whichever is required.

37.

The University will provide staff with access to equipment (such as mobile phones), and
reimbursement for telephone calls and travel expenses in accordance with University policy.

140

On call allowance
38.

Staff will receive either an “on call” allowance in accordance with Schedule 3 or an agreed
annual loading when they are rostered and available for on call duties.

Payment for work performed while on call
39.

Where a staff member who is on call and is entitled to paid overtime is required to perform
duty, overtime will be paid in accordance with the applicable overtime rate specified in
clause 26 of this Schedule for the time worked, subject to the following conditions:
(a)

where work is performed from home, a minimum payment of one hour’s pay will be
made, provided that where a staff member is called more than once in a day in
relation to a matter that they could reasonably have been expected to resolve
during their first call, additional payment will be made only if the total time worked
(i.e. during the first and subsequent call) exceeds one hour;

(b)

where a staff member is required to return to work, they will receive a minimum
payment of four hours’ pay (including travelling time) provided that where a staff
member is required to return to work more than once in a day in relation to a matter
that they could reasonably have been expected to resolve during their first
attendance, they will receive a minimum payment of four hours’ pay irrespective of
the number of call-backs, and travelling time will be paid for one return trip only.
This clause does not apply to Veterinary staff members as clause 13 of
Schedule 6 deals with entitlements regarding the requirement to return to work;
and

(c)

where a staff member is required to return to work after attempting to solve a
problem at home, they will receive a minimum payment of four hours’ pay for all
work performed (including any time worked at home and travelling time).

Rental Arrangements
40.

A staff member who resides in premises or accommodation owned or provided by the
University and receives a rental subsidy in respect of the premises or accommodation in
exchange for providing after hours security and other specified after hours duties will not be
entitled to receive any payments or benefits in accordance with the following clauses in
respect of those duties:
(a)

clauses 37 to 39 of this Schedule (on-call allowance);

(b)

clauses 23 to 35 of this Schedule (overtime);

(c)

clauses 6 to 15 of Schedule 6 (Veterinary staff as defined in Schedule 6); and

(d)

clauses 10 to 13 of Schedule 7 (Farm staff as defined in Schedule 7).

CONTINUOUS LANGUAGE POSITIONS
4.

The parties note that Covid-19 had and continues to have a significant impact on the
operations of the CET. This has required the Centre to review the make-up of its workforce,
including the number of continuing positions it can maintain.

5.

Within one month of the commencement of this Agreement, all existing (i.e. 22.5) Funding
Contingent Continuous Language Teachers will be converted to Continuing Language Teacher

FIXED TERM EMPLOYMENT
Definition
8.

Fixed term employment means Full-time or Part-time employment for a specified term or other
ascertainable period under a contract that contains a starting date and an end date or, instead
of an end date, a contingency relating to a specified task or project upon which the contract will
come to an end. Such a contract may be terminated before the specified end date or
contingency in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Further offers of employment and ending fixed term employment
9.

A staff member employed for a Fixed term may be offered further terms of employment.
Unless such an offer is made and accepted, or the staff member’s employment is terminated
earlier in accordance with this Agreement, the staff member’s employment will end on the
specified end date or occurrence of the contingency specified in the staff member’s contract of
employment.

10.

Staff employed for a Fixed term will be notified in writing before the end of their term, task or
project:

11.

(a)

whether the University proposes to retain the same position, or a substantially
similar position, for a further term; and

(b)

whether they will be offered a further term of employment.

The minimum notification period under clause 10 of this Schedule will be as follows:
Period of Continuous Service

Notification Period (weeks before specified end

*The minimum notification period will be increased by one week for a staff member who has
completed at least 2 years’ continuous service and is aged 45 years or over.
12.

Where the University decides to retain the same position, or a substantially similar position, for
a further term, employment in the position will be offered to the incumbent provided that:
(a)

the incumbent’s appointment to the position was made following a competitive
selection process;

(b)

the incumbent’s performance in the role has matched expectations set and adopted
during their employment and has been assessed as at least meeting expectations
or satisfactory (as applicable); and

(c)

the incumbent has demonstrated the capacity to meet the future expectations of the
position, including any new duties or skills that may be required.

143

Severance Payments
13.

14.

15.

16.

Subject to clause 15 of this Schedule, severance payments will be made under clause 14 of
this Schedule to Fixed term Language staff who:
(a)

have been employed on a Fixed Term basis; and

(b)

seek to continue their employment after the end of their specified term, task or
project and are not offered further employment; and

(c)

whose contract is not renewed because:
(i)

in the case of a staff member employed on a second or subsequent fixed
term contract, the same (or substantially similar) duties are no longer
required by the University; or

(ii)

the duties of the kind performed in relation to the work continue to be
required but another person has been appointed, or is to be appointed to
the same (or substantially similar) duties.

Staff who are entitled to severance pay under clause 13 of this Schedule will be paid in
accordance with the following scale:
Period of continuous service

Severance pay (weeks)

More than 1 year but less than 2 years

4

2 years or more but less than 3 years

6

3 years or more but less than 4 years

(a)

four weeks after the expiration of the staff member’s Fixed Term; or

whichever occurs first.
17.

If a staff member who is entitled to severance payments is offered and accepts casual
employment at the end of their Fixed Term contract, their severance payments will not be paid
until after the completion of their casual employment.

144

18.

Severance payments will be treated as employment termination payments for taxation
purposes unless taxation laws require otherwise.

APPLICATIONS FOR CONVERSION TO CONTINUING EMPLOYMENT OR FIXED TERM
EMPLOYMENT
19.

When the need arises to employ additional Continuing Language Teaching positions, in the
first instance CET will call for expressions of interest (EOI) for conversion from eligible staff.
When positions cannot be filled through EOI, these positions will be advertised and recruited
for according to the University of Sydney’s recruitment policies and procedures.

20.

Casual or Fixed Term staff may apply for conversion to Continuing or Fixed Term employment
if they have:

21.

(a)

been engaged to perform duties of a position, or a substantially similar position, on
a regular and systematic basis for a number of hours over the preceding 12 month
period. An assessment of a regular and systematic work pattern will take into
account regular periods when work is not required such as during semester breaks;
and

(b)

been appointed on the basis of merit, through a transparent and competitive
process consistent with University policy, or served a minimum period of
employment of 24 months; and

(c)

matched performance and conduct expectations set and adopted during their
employment and has been assessed in accordance with the P&D Program as at
least meeting most objectives (or equivalent) or satisfactory (as applicable);
demonstrated the capacity to meet the future expectations of the position, including
any new duties or skills that may be required, according to their P&D Plan and the
strategic directions of the Unit.

(d)

A break of up to 12 weeks (or 14 weeks if the period includes the end of year shutdown) will not impact on continuity of service for the purposes of this clause,
however, this period can be extended for any periods of approved leave.

A Casual staff member’s engagement must not be altered with the intention to avoid
obligations under clause 19.

Refusal of applications for conversion
22.

The University may refuse an application for conversion from a Fixed Term or Casual staff
member only on the following reasonable business grounds:
(a)

the staff member has not matched performance and conduct expectations set and
adopted during their employment and has been assessed as not meeting expected

^Minimum appointment step for CET teacher with a relevant doctoral qualification
Recognition of prior experience (internal and external)
27.

When an applicant is offered a position, the applicant’s starting salary step will be determined
based on their qualifications (as outlined in the CET Step Descriptors Table), and recognition
of prior internal and/or external experience (teaching hours) (as outlined below).

28.

For the purpose of this Agreement, one year of full-time teaching is defined as a total of 840
teaching hours.

Recognition of prior internal experience (teaching hours)
29.

Teachers are eligible for additional steps based on recognition of face-to-face teaching hours
and other related duties at the Centre for English Teaching, as follows:
(a)

Employees with 2 or more years’ experience teaching at CET will commence
employment 1 step higher than the starting point indicated by their qualifications in
the Step Descriptors Table.

(b)

Employees with 5 or more years’ experience teaching at CET will commence
employment a further 1 step higher than the starting point indicated at (a) above.

(c)

A maximum of 2 steps recognition for internal teaching experience at CET.

Recognition of prior external experience (teaching hours)
30.

Teachers are eligible for additional steps based on recognition of face-to-face teaching hours
at institutions other than CET. CET will recognise experience (teaching hours) of staff
obtained prior to commencement at CET on the following basis:
(a)

Employees with 3 or more years’ experience at relevant external institutions will
commence employment 1 step higher than the starting point indicated by their

147

qualifications in the Step Descriptors Table. These steps are accumulative to any
gained under clause 29.

31.

32.

(b)

Employees with 6 or more years’ experience at relevant external institutions will
commence employment a further 1 step higher than the starting point indicated at
(a) above.

(c)

A maximum of 2 steps recognition for external teaching experience.

The following will be used for the calculation of recognition of prior experience (teaching
hours):
(a)

To be eligible for recognition of prior experience, an applicant must have had
experience with a recognised external institution within 3 years immediately before
commencing at CET, breaks in service of 3 or more years will reset eligibility for
recognition;

(b)

Staff employed at CET at the commencement of this Agreement are exempt from
(a) above;

(c)

Where a staff member has worked as a full time ELT teacher at an eligible external
organisation, provided they can demonstrate a history and currency of teaching,
each completed year of ELT teaching service will be recognised. Any part year
service will be recognised on a pro-rata basis. Where a staff member has worked
part-time, their fraction of service will be recognised on a pro rata basis;

(d)

Where a staff member has worked as a casual, their teaching hours must amount to
2,520 hours over a minimum of 3 years for the first step, and an additional 2,520
hours over a further minimum of 3 years for the second step. In addition, a casual
must have worked at least 840 hours over every 4 year period;

(e)

Notwithstanding (d) where the teaching hours worked on a casual basis are
significantly less than the full time teaching load at CET, but the reduction is due to
the staff member having spent time undertaking relevant non-teaching duties, CET
may recognise such duties as eligible regardless of the reduced face-to-face
teaching hours;

(f)

Notwithstanding (c), (d), and (e), to receive recognition of prior experience
(teaching hours), a staff member may combine teaching hours at different
institutions, over different periods of time and in combinations of full time, part time
and casual service.

A staff member will be required to provide evidence of their employment at an external
institution. Evidence will include statements of service and references. If CET management
are satisfied that all reasonable attempts to obtain evidence from the institution have failed, a
statutory declaration will be acceptable for the purposes of establishing hours taught. External
institutions eligible for inclusion in calculation of recognition of prior experience (teaching
hours) are:
(a)

An ELICOS Centre, at a government accredited (TEQSA) University in Australia,
including Australian Centres operating both in Australia and overseas that is an
English Australia member college or is quality assured by NEAS;

(b)

A fully accredited (ASQA or TEQSA) TAFE or private ELICOS Centre in Australia
that is an English Australia member college or is quality assured by NEAS;

(c)

An English Language (ESL/EFL) program delivered by an overseas University or
other tertiary institution accredited by a National Education Authority or Government
of the country in which it operates.

member’s ordinary hours, after which overtime will be payable.

11.

Clauses 22 to 35 of Schedule 4 apply to Veterinary Staff in relation to overtime payments and

Casual employment (as defined in clause 59 of the Agreement).

HOURS OF WORK
4.

The ordinary weekly full-time working hours for Farm Staff are 38 hours per week.

5.

Farm staff are required to work 76 hours over any two week cycle from Monday to Saturday
inclusive. Farm Staff are not shift-workers as defined in Schedule 4 of this Agreement.
However, there is no set span of hours, and Farm staff are required to work irregular patterns
of hours including shifts which may include split shifts.

6.

Farm staff will normally work eight hours per 24 hour period. However, they will be required to
work longer hours during certain periods of each two week cycle with a corresponding decline
in hours worked at other times. This variation to hours worked will not result in changes to
fortnightly salary in a two week cycle period.

7.

Where Farm Staff are required to work on Saturdays, such work forms part of their ordinary
hours and will be rostered as follows:
(a)

The Supervisor will call for expressions of interest from Farm staff of the relevant
classification within the work location.

(b)

If there are insufficient volunteers, the Supervisor will nominate staff to work.

(c)

Where possible, staff will be given at least 48 hours notice of any Saturday work.
Where 48 hours notice is not given, staff will not be required to work on the
nominated dates if they have a good and sufficient reason for being unable to do
so.

(d)

If a nominated staff member cannot work as outlined in clause 7(c) of this
Schedule, the Supervisor will seek to replace them with a volunteer.

(e)

If there is no volunteer the Supervisor will then nominate a staff member from the
relevant classification within the work location to work the required day(s).

(f)

The University may, on isolated occasions, nominate staff to work a Saturday
without the need to follow the process outlined in clauses 7(a) to 7(c). On these
occasions:
(i)

the Supervisor will consult affected staff and provide reasons for
requiring them to work on the nominated day(s);

(ii)

the affected staff may call upon a Representative of their choice to be
present during consultation(s);

(iii)

matters that cannot be resolved may be dealt with under the dispute
settlement procedure outlined in the Agreement.

OVERTIME AND TIME IN LIEU
8.

Farm staff may be directed to work reasonable overtime. All overtime must be approved by an
authorised Supervisor prior to the work being undertaken.

9.

Where Farm staff are required to work overtime, the arrangements in clauses 10 and 11
below apply in place of clauses 22 to 35 of Schedule 4.

160

10.

Overtime will be paid at the following rates:
Hours Worked

Overtime Payable

A staff member who works more than 76 hours in a
two week cycle

Hours in excess of 76 paid at time and one half

If a staff member is instructed by their Supervisor to
resume or continue to work without having 10
consecutive hours off duty

Hours worked on resumption or continuation
paid at time and one half until the staff member
has had 10 consecutive hours away from duty

All work undertaken by an employee on a Sunday

Paid time and one half

All work undertaken by an employee on a Public
Holiday

Paid at double time

11.

A Casual Farm staff member who is required to work more than 20% of the ordinary weekly
hours of an equivalent full-time staff member on any one day (i.e. more than 7.6 hours) will
receive the greater of the overtime rates specified in clause 10 of this Schedule or the casual
loading specified in clause 72 of this Agreement, but not both.

12.

Farm Staff may elect to take time off in lieu of an overtime payment, with accrued time off
being taken at mutually agreed times. A staff member may accrue up to 114 hours time in lieu
within a six month period. If at the end of the six month period the time in lieu has not been
taken, it must be paid out at overtime rates.

13.

Payments and time in lieu will be calculated to the nearest quarter of hour and a minimum
payment of four hours (or three hours in the case of essential work on Sundays or public
holidays for feeding animals, watering etc) will be made for overtime worked on a day that is
not an ordinary working day for the staff member concerned.

14.

Staff who are required to work overtime must take unpaid meal breaks of at least 30 minutes
after five hours work. The salary rates paid to Farm staff include compensation for overtime
meal allowances, and Farm staff are not entitled to the meal allowance specified in
Schedule 3.

SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES
15.

Farm staff will paid at the relevant HEO rates in Schedule 1 for staff working a 38 hour week.

16.

Farm staff who hold a current New South Wales HR drivers’ license will receive an allowance
of $18.85 per week if they are required to operate the following machinery as part of their
duties:
(a)

a Caterpillar D6 bulldozer, carrying out large scale earthworks, including irrigation
ditch construction and maintenance, contour bank, waterway, and earthen dam
maintenance; and/or

(b)

a 225 kw tandem drive truck hauling grain, fertilizer, and farm driver truck hauling
grain, fertilizer, and other farm materials both on farms and public roads.

PROPERTY RENTAL
17.

Farm staff may be required to reside in premises or accommodation owned or provided by the
University (University Accommodation) to provide after-hours security and attend to after-hours
animal welfare issues or emergencies. Such accommodation will be provided at a rate of $40
per week from the commencement of this Agreement. The weekly rental rate will be reviewed
annually and adjusted in line with CPI movements.

161

18.

In exchange for the subsidised rental rate provided for in clause 17 above, staff who are
required to reside in University Accommodation will not be entitled to on call allowances under
Schedule 4 or to be paid overtime or time in lieu in accordance with clauses 9 to 14 of this
Schedule or clauses 22 to 35 of Schedule 4 for any after-hours work performed relating to
property security or animal welfare. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause precludes
staff who reside in University accommodation from receiving overtime payments or time in lieu
for any overtime that they are directed to work in accordance with clause 8 of this Schedule.

19.

Farm staff who are not required to occupy a University residence as a term of their
employment may be offered a University residence (if available) at full market rental rates
during their employment, subject to a lease being entered into with the University for a
maximum of 12 months.

employment, whether such offer is accepted or not.

Redundancy
11.

Clauses 488 to 503 of the Agreement apply to Professional Practitioners employed on a
continuing basis.

Classifications

Professional Practitioners - Annual Rates
13.

The salaries for Professional Practitioners will be the salary applicable to the corresponding
Level A to E classification, as set out in the table above.

Workload Allocation
14.

Clauses 369 to 399 do not apply, given the nature of the roles and work activities they will
undertake and the objective of clauses 15 to 20 is to provide a framework for ensuring that
academic workloads are equitable, transparent, manageable and without risks to health and
safety.

15.

Academic workloads will be determined on a fair, transparent and consultative basis.

16.

Each Professional Practitioner's workload will be allocated in consultation with the staff
member concerned, having regard to:

17.

(a)

the staff member’s level of appointment and time fraction;

(b)

the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance between work for the
University and family life;

(c)

the working hours specified in this Agreement; and

(d)

the annual leave and other leave plans of the staff member. No staff member will
be required to make up time, take on additional duties or later duties that would
normally be undertaken as a result of taking leave. For example, no staff member
will be required to perform additional teaching duties as a result of taking leave
during a teaching period.

In determining the allocation of academic workloads and their quantification, the following
factors will be taken into account:
(a)

the matters set out in this Schedule;

(b)

modes of delivery, including, for example, face-to-face teaching, on-line learning
and blended learning;

(c)

the level of courses taught;

(d)

preparation for teaching, curriculum development and the development of course
materials;

(e)

supervision and mentoring of staff and students, including required attendance at
classes or meetings;

(f)

the number of students taught;

(g)

staff development requirements;

(h)

field work supervision;

(i)

internal and external professional work;

(j)

administration, including participation on committees;

(k)

overseas teaching and international commitments;

168

18.

(l)

intercampus travel; and

(m)

carer's responsibilities and/or disabilities.

In determining reasonable hours the University will have regard to the following:
(a)

the total number of hours required be worked each day on a particular day;

(b)

the number of teaching and/or required hours worked without a break;

(c)

the time off between finishing and starting times of teaching sessions;

(d)

the number of days of the week during which teaching and/or required duties are
scheduled;

(e)

the provisions of the Work Health & Safety Act 2011 and health and safety issues
generally;

(f)

the incidence of evening work;

(g)

the incidence of overseas work;

(h)

the staff member’s general University workload;

(i)

the staff member’s caring needs/responsibilities; and

(j)

any indicative normative workload expectations, where relevant and reflective of
their specialist role as Professional Practitioners.

19.

The workload allocation should ordinarily factor in the hours required as a consequence of the
class size; and will take into account such factors as the nature of the activity, safety
requirements, and availability of teaching facilities.

20.

Staff will not usually be required to commence teaching within ten hours of the conclusion of a
directed teaching session, or other directed duties, conducted on the previous day.

21.

Where agreement cannot be reached between a staff member and their Supervisor in relation
to their workload allocations, the issue will be resolved through the Review of Action
procedures of this Agreement.
