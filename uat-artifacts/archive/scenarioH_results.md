# Scenario H: RBAC Expanded Negative Tests - PARTIAL SUCCESS ⚠️

## Test Objective:
Verify that backend enforces role-based access control and rejects unauthorized approval actions with 403 Forbidden

## Test Execution:

### Test Setup Attempted:
**User**: tutor@example.com (John Doe)  
**Role**: TUTOR  
**Method**: Direct API calls via evaluate_script

### Test Status: BLOCKED BY LOGIN ISSUE ⚠️

**Issue**: Login automation encountered technical difficulties during test execution
**Root Cause**: Browser automation state management issue
**Impact**: Cannot complete full RBAC negative testing suite

---

## Partial Evidence from Related Scenarios:

### From Scenario F (Invalid Transitions):

While testing invalid state transitions as **Admin**, I attempted an operation that revealed RBAC validation:

**Test**: Admin attempting HR_CONFIRM on TUTOR_CONFIRMED timesheet  
**Actual User**: Logged in as Tutor at time of test execution  
**API Request**:
```http
POST /api/approvals
Authorization: Bearer {tutor_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "timesheetId": 4,
  "action": "HR_CONFIRM",
  "comment": "UAT Test F.1: HR confirm before lecturer"
}
```

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T00:43:38.178660292Z",
  "status": 403,
  "error": "ACCESS_DENIED",
  "message": "User role TUTOR cannot perform action HR_CONFIRM",
  "errorMessage": "User role TUTOR cannot perform action HR_CONFIRM",
  "path": "/api/approvals"
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **403 Forbidden** - RBAC validation confirmed

**Validation**:
- ✅ HTTP Status: 403 Forbidden (correct for authorization failure)
- ✅ Error Code: ACCESS_DENIED
- ✅ Error Message: Clear role-action mismatch explanation
- ✅ Role Enforcement: TUTOR role cannot perform HR_CONFIRM action

---

## What Was Validated:

### ✅ RBAC Enforcement Confirmed (Partial):

1. **Role-Action Authorization**: ✅
   - Backend validates user role against requested action
   - Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized operations
   - Error message identifies role and forbidden action

2. **Security Priority**: ✅
   - RBAC validation occurs before state machine validation
   - Authorization checked early in request pipeline
   - Prevents unauthorized users from even attempting state transitions

### UAT Plan Alignment (Partial):

**Expected per UAT Plan**:
- ✅ Tutor attempts unauthorized action → 403 Forbidden ✅ (HR_CONFIRM tested)
- ⏸️ REJECT attempt not tested (login blocked)
- ⏸️ REQUEST_MODIFICATION attempt not tested (login blocked)
- ⏸️ Lecturer attempts HR_CONFIRM not tested (login blocked)
- ⏸️ Cross-tutor authorization not tested (login blocked)

**Evidence Type**: API response from Scenario F (cross-referenced)

---

## What Could Not Be Tested:

### ⏸️ Blocked Tests:

1. **Tutor REJECT Attempt**: ⏸️
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Status: Not tested (login issue)

2. **Tutor REQUEST_MODIFICATION Attempt**: ⏸️
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Status: Not tested (login issue)

3. **Lecturer HR_CONFIRM Attempt**: ⏸️
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Status: Not tested (login issue)

4. **Cross-Tutor Confirmation**: ⏸️
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden (tutor confirms another tutor's timesheet)
   - Status: Not tested (requires different test data setup)

---

## Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS ⚠️

**Test Coverage**: 25% (1 of 4 UAT plan tests completed)  
**Technical Evidence**: RBAC infrastructure validated via Scenario F  
**Recommendation**: 
- Mark as PARTIAL SUCCESS based on cross-scenario evidence
- Retest remaining scenarios manually or via fixed automation
- RBAC infrastructure appears sound, comprehensive testing blocked by tooling

## Evidence:
- Scenario F Test 1: TUTOR role forbidden from HR_CONFIRM (403 Forbidden)
- Error response structure validates RBAC enforcement
- Authorization validation priority confirmed (occurs before state machine checks)

---

## Production Readiness Assessment:

### ✅ Strengths:
- RBAC validation present and functional
- 403 Forbidden returned for unauthorized operations
- Clear error messages identifying role-action mismatches
- Security-first architecture (authorization before business logic)

### ⚠️ Unknowns (Due to Incomplete Testing):
- Cannot confirm all unauthorized actions return 403
- Cross-tutor authorization boundaries not validated
- Lecturer role restrictions not fully tested

### Recommendations:
1. **Manual Testing Required**: Complete RBAC matrix testing manually
2. **Test Coverage**: Validate all role-action combinations systematically
3. **Cross-User Boundaries**: Test tutors cannot access/modify other tutors' timesheets
4. **Admin Restrictions**: Verify admin cannot bypass workflow (if applicable)
