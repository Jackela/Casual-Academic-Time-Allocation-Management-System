 * @param tutor The target tutor for the timesheet. Must be non-null with role TUTOR,
 *              active status, and assignment to the specified course.
 * @param course The course context for timesheet creation. Must be non-null, active,

```java
/**
 * <p><strong>Status-Based Editing Rules:</strong>
 * <li><strong>DRAFT</strong>: Editable by owner (TUTOR) or course authority (LECTURER/ADMIN)</li>
 * <li><strong>MODIFICATION_REQUESTED</strong>: Editable by owner to address requested changes</li>
 * <li><strong>PENDING_TUTOR_REVIEW</strong>: Not editable (under review)</li>
