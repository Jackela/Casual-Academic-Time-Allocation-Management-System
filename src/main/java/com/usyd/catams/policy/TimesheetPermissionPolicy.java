/**
 * Strategic authorization policy interface for comprehensive timesheet operation permissions.
 * 
 * <p>This interface abstracts all authorization logic from the ApplicationService layer,
 * implementing the Strategy Pattern to enable flexible permission strategies while maintaining
 * clean separation between business orchestration and authorization concerns.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Business Context:</strong> Implements role-based access control (RBAC) with 
 * hierarchical permissions (ADMIN > LECTURER > TUTOR), ownership-based validation, 
 * resource-based authority checks, and status-aware permissions aligned with the approval workflow.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Authorization Matrix:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>ADMIN</strong>: Full access to all timesheet operations across all courses and users</li>
 * <li><strong>LECTURER</strong>: Can manage timesheets for courses they teach, including creation and approval</li>
 * <li><strong>TUTOR</strong>: Can manage (view/create/edit) their own timesheets within permitted statuses</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Design Patterns Implemented:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong>: Enables different authorization implementations (default, LDAP, OAuth)</li>
 * <li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle</strong>: ApplicationService depends on this abstraction</li>
 * <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>: Pure authorization logic, no business orchestration</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> All implementations must be stateless and thread-safe for concurrent access.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Authorization checks should complete in <1ms. Implementations may cache
 * course authority relationships for performance optimization.
 * 
 * @invariant All permission methods must handle null parameters gracefully and return false for invalid inputs
 * @invariant Role hierarchy ADMIN > LECTURER > TUTOR must be consistently enforced across all methods
 * @invariant Status-based permissions must align with ApprovalStateMachine workflow rules
 * 
 * @see DefaultTimesheetPermissionPolicy for the default role-based implementation
 * @see ApprovalStateMachine for workflow status rules
 * @see TimesheetApplicationService for usage patterns
