# Story 2.1: Implement Lecturer Approval Workflow (Approve/Reject)

## Story Information
- **Epic:** 2 - Interactive Approval Workflow
- **Story:** 2.1
- **Title:** Implement Lecturer Approval Workflow (Approve/Reject)
- **Status:** Ready for Review
- **Assigned to:** James ðŸ’» (Dev Agent)
- **Story Points:** [To be estimated]

## Story Statement
**As a** LECTURER, 
**I want** to be able to review timesheets that have been submitted for my approval and decide whether to approve or reject them,
**so that** I can ensure accurate time tracking for my courses and control the quality of timesheet submissions before they proceed to HR review.

This functionality represents the first step in the interactive approval process, enabling LECTURERs to manage the workflow of timesheet approvals for their assigned courses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** A new endpoint, `GET /api/timesheets/pending-approval`, is created. When called by an authenticated LECTURER, it returns a paginated list of timesheets with the status `PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL` that belong to their courses.
- **AC2:** A LECTURER can successfully `POST` to `/api/approvals` with an `action` of `APPROVE` for a pending timesheet. The timesheet's status must change to `APPROVED` (or `PENDING_HR_REVIEW` as per the spec).
- **AC3:** A LECTURER can successfully `POST` to `/api/approvals` with an `action` of `REJECT` for a pending timesheet. The timesheet's status must change to `REJECTED`.
- **AC4:** A user who is not the designated LECTURER for the course cannot approve or reject the timesheet, resulting in a `403 Forbidden` error.
- **AC5:** Attempting to approve or reject a timesheet that is not in the `PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL` state results in a `400 Bad Request` error.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies and Context
Story 2.1 directly builds upon Story 1.3 completion, leveraging the following established components:
- **Approval Infrastructure**: ApprovalController, ApprovalService, and ApprovalServiceImpl already exist [Source: Story 1.3 completion]
- **Approval Entity**: Approval entity and ApprovalRepository already implemented [Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record]
- **DTOs**: ApprovalActionRequest and ApprovalActionResponse DTOs already exist [Source: Story 1.3 implementation]
- **POST /api/approvals**: Endpoint already implemented with SUBMIT_FOR_APPROVAL action [Source: Story 1.3 AC3]
- **JWT Authentication**: Full JWT and RBAC system already configured [Source: Story 1.3 dependencies]

### OpenAPI Contract Compliance
Must strictly follow `docs/openapi.yaml` specifications:

**GET /api/timesheets/pending-approval** [Lines 702-851]:
- **Access Control**: LECTURER (own courses only), ADMIN (all), TUTOR (403 Forbidden)
- **Response Schema**: `TimesheetPageResponse` with pagination support
- **Query Parameters**: page, size, sort, courseId (ADMIN only)
- **Business Rules**: Only returns PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL status timesheets
- **Default Sort**: createdAt,asc (oldest submissions first for priority)
- **Error Responses**: 401 (unauthenticated), 403 (insufficient permissions), 500 (server error)

**POST /api/approvals** [Lines 852-999]:
- **New Actions Required**: APPROVE and REJECT (in addition to existing SUBMIT_FOR_APPROVAL)
- **Request Schema**: `ApprovalActionRequest` with timesheetId, action, comment
- **Response Schema**: `ApprovalActionResponse` with newStatus, approverId, timestamp, nextSteps
- **Workflow Transitions**: 
  - PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL â†’ APPROVED â†’ auto-transition to PENDING_HR_REVIEW
  - PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL â†’ REJECTED (final state)
- **Authorization**: LECTURER can only approve/reject timesheets for their courses
- **Error Responses**: 400 (invalid state transition), 403 (not course lecturer), 404 (timesheet not found)

### Data Models and DTOs
Based on existing implementation from Story 1.3, the following are already available:

**ApprovalActionRequest DTO** [Source: Story 1.3]:
```java
public class ApprovalActionRequest {
    @NotNull(message = "Timesheet ID is required")
    private Long timesheetId;
    
    @NotNull(message = "Action is required")
    private ApprovalAction action; // Now includes APPROVE, REJECT
    
    @Size(max = 500, message = "Comment cannot exceed 500 characters")
    private String comment;
}
```

**ApprovalAction Enum** [Needs Extension]:
```java
public enum ApprovalAction {
    SUBMIT_FOR_APPROVAL,  // Already implemented
    APPROVE,              // New for Story 2.1
    REJECT,               // New for Story 2.1  
    REQUEST_MODIFICATION  // Future story
}
```

**ApprovalStatus Enum** [Source: Story 1.3]:
```java
public enum ApprovalStatus {
    DRAFT,
    PENDING_LECTURER_APPROVAL,  // Already implemented
    APPROVED,                   // New status for Story 2.1
    REJECTED,                   // New status for Story 2.1
    PENDING_HR_REVIEW,         // Auto-transition target
    FINAL_APPROVED
}
```

### API Specifications
**GET /api/timesheets/pending-approval**:
