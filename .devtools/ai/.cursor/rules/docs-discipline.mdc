# Project Rule â€” Documentation Discipline

## Obligations after code changes
- Update `PROJECT_DOCS.md` immediately when code/structure/flows change.
- Keep diagrams up to date (Mermaid): project structure (`graph TD`), interaction sequences (`sequenceDiagram`), class diagrams (`classDiagram`), flowcharts (`flowchart TD`).
- Keep baseline metadata (version/date/scope) current.

## Style & content
- Be concise and precise; prefer clear headings and bullet points.
- Keep SSOT references in docs (where core rules live) to avoid magic values in prose and examples.

## Notes
- Do not document Cursor rules in the repo since `.cursor/` is gitignored by policy.
